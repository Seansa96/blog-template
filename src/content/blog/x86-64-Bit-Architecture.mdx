title: x86-64 Bit Architecture
---

The computer architecture used in most modern computing systems.  This is backwards compatible with x86, which utilizes a 32 bit address space.

This allows for the use of a QWORD that may be 4 bytes or 8 bytes.

It is an extension of Intel's x86 32-bit instruction set architecture.  Thus, the registers, instructions, memory addresses, and operands are all 64 bits wide.

The amount of General Purpose Registers available are 16, up from 8, and of course, as mentioned, are 64-bit up from 32.  

It also provides Long Mode and compatibility mode, which is how it integrates with software that only utilizes the 32 or 16 bit address space.

The instruction encoding in this architecture *can* be up to 15 bytes long.  They also are multi-faceted in their composition, having prefixes, opcodes and immediate values.

Exception handling in this architecture is table-based with pointers to the exception occurrences rather than stack based as in x86's implementation.

Floating point precision in this model is also supported in a much broader scope, with 16 128-bit vector registers.  Each of these registers can store one or two double-precision floating point numbers, up to four single-precision floating-point numbers.

In this model, memory segmentation is deprecated for paging, which utilizes a virtualized address space managed by the OS using the Memory Management Unit.
