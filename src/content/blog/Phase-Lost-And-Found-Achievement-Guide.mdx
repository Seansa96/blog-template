# Tips on Completing the Achievement

As of right now, the absolute fastest way to do this is to go into **K'aresh** in **non War Mode** and realm hop using world boss groups for **Reshanor, the Untethered**.

This method, if you have little competition on your shards, should only take you around 2 hours or so. However, many players are currently utilizing this strategy, so you will likely take upwards of 3+ hours doing so.

The method I recommend, and will reference in this guide, is much less involved and can be done quite easily assuming average RNG in around 3 hours, and has *much* less competition.

You should **start in War mode**, and go in whatever circle you desire around **Tazavesh**, hitting every single point, then hitting the waypoints listed in the **Quick Peeks** section, then *changing to non war mode*, coming back, and repeating the route, and then alternating just like that until you complete the achievement.  

Doing it this way, I had practically no competition and most of the time got 80% of the orbs in a single lap, essentially.
