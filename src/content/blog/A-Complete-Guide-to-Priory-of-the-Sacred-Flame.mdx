You can find his <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/yodatv">Twitch here as well.</a> He is a very skilled and knowledgeable tank, and as I was unable to obtain any good footage of Priory during the PTR cycle, I substituted his in place of mine until I acquire better once the content has gone live.*

This is by a noticeable amount the hardest key of the dungeon pool, as of current writing.  It is a rather short but intense experience that requires fighting quite an incredible amount of trash that has quite extreme amounts of health and does an exceptional amount of damage if handled incorrectly, combined with two of the hardest bosses in the dungeon pool.

You will want a balanced composition for this instance, as too many melee can make the second and third bosses quite difficult.

This guide is focused on providing a complete understanding of the dungeon at a base level of +10, and the warnings I provide will focus around such.  There is still plenty of knowledge to be gained here even for more advanced players, and everything here still applies to lower keys, but you should approach comprehension with this in mind.

# Trash to Captain Dailcry

This is a rather open area with a wealth of patrolling mobs, which can make the space feel quite cramped at times. You will need to draw out two of **Dailcry's** companions in order to make fighting him possible, and thus can technically choose what combination you would like to fight the boss with.  I will recommend, as of current tuning, the easiest possible companion to fight **Dailcry** with, and take you through the path that will achieve this.

The dungeon will begin with a patrol coming down the corridor in front of you.  You should pull that pack into several others and Lust, scaling the pull size as you feel comfortable with. For full details, observe the <a href="#Routing and Lust Recommendations">Routing and Lust Recommendations</a> section.

You will choose to engage with **Guard Captain Suleyman**, who patrols the courtyard and summons **Sergeant Shaynemail**, and **Forge Master Damian**, who summons **Elaena Emberlanz** as of current writing.

* **Arathi Knight** - These are a lieutenant mob, and they have three abilities. The first is **Defend**, which works similar to other mobs in this area, placing an observable barrier around themselves that reduces the damage taken of themselves and any other allies within by 50%, **Impale**, which targets a random player and deals moderate damage before afflicting them with a heavy bleed, and **Disrupting Shout**, a non-interruptible cast which deals moderate damage to the group and interrupts any casts when it completes.
* **Fervent Sharpshooter** - These are ranged type archer mobs that do not move easily. They spam **Shoot** for moderate damage on a random target and cast **Pot Shot**, a non-interruptible cast that deals heavy damage and also cast **Caltrops**, a non-interruptible instant ability which spawns several traps around players, rooting them and afflicting them with a heavy bleed if they are caught in them.  They will leap towards melee after a random period of time if they are left by themselves long enough, which is more helpful than anything. If they live long enough, they will also leap out of the melee stack.
* **Arathi Footman** - These melee and cast **Defend**, a non-interruptible cast that provides an observable barrier around them, reducing theirs and any allies damage taken by 50%. Disrupting this with stops shatters their defenses, causing them to take 25% increased damage instead.

**Mini-boss 1**

* **Guard Captain Suleyman** - He has two abilities: **Thunderclap**, which deals moderate damage to the entire group and slows everyone by 30%, and **Shield Slam**, which deals moderate damage to the tank and knocks them back quite a ways.
* **Shield Slam** <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/priory/shieldslam.webp"/>
* Defeating **Suleyman** will cause **Sergeant Shaynemail** to run to the location where he was killed.
* You may choose to engage **Suleyman** with other mobs, but I'd advise against doing so with **Shaynemail** until you are more comfortable with the dungeon.

**Mini-boss 2**

* **Sergeant Shaynemail** - He has two abilities, **Lunging Strike**, which causes him to leap to a random player and deal light damage to them and anyone within 5 yards, as well as afflict them all with a moderate bleed, and **Brutal Smash**, a moderate, non-interruptible cast that deals lethal to anyone around **Shaynemail** in the indicated visual as well as stunning them

I will now return to covering the remainder of trash in this area before discussing the other two mini-bosses.

* **Devout Priest** - This is a caster that has 3 abilities. The first is **Inner Fire**, a non-interruptible cast that will buff the caster, causing them to deal 50% increased damage for 10 seconds. Dispelling this off of them will stun them for 4 seconds.  They will spam **Holy Smite**, an interruptible cast that deals moderate damage and lastly cast **Greater Heal**, an interruptible cast that heals a random ally for 50% health, preferring the lowest nearby target.
* **War Lynx** - These will melee and do an ability called **Pounce**, which causes them to leap at a random player and afflict them with **Grievous RIp**, a heavy DoT that persists until they are healed to full HP.
* **Fanatical Conjuror** - These casters use a single ability called **Fireball**, which deals borderline heavy damage to a single target, and is interruptible.

**Mini-boss 3**

* **Forge Master Damian** - This is the hardest mini-boss overall and while simple, can easily result in deaths.  He has two abilities--the first is **Heat Wave**, which deals high damage to the entire group and reduces their movement speed by 70%. The second is **Seal of Flame**, which increases his damage by 50% and causes him to spawn pools of fire at nearby locations with successful auto attacks. These pools are ejected from the forge, and when they land they do high damage. It is worth noting that because of this, if you tank him on the stairs, ranged can simply stand around 30 yards away and will be out of range of the spawning pools. Melee will still need to be quite wary of the pools, especially the ones that spawn during the **Heat Wave** cast.

**Mini-boss 4**

* **Elaena Emberlanz** - This mini-boss is rather simple, doing only a tankbuster called **Divine Judgment**, which deals moderate damage and applies a magic debuff that increases damage taken by 25%, and **Holy Radiance**, which is a channeled AoE that deals moderate damage to the group over time.
* <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/priory/holyradiance.webp"/>

# Captain Dailcry

This fight takes place against **Dailcry** and whatever companion you chose to leave by his side. You need only to kill **Dailcry** to end the encounter, though you will deal with both of their abilities. I will only explain the abilities of the companion I currently recommend you battle, and will update it if tuning changes this.

**Captain Dailcry**

* **Pierce Armor** - **Dailcry** uses this on his current target, dealing moderate upfront damage and applying a moderate bleed to them. This can stack.
* **Hurl Spear** - **Dailcry** selects a random player, throwing a thin spear in their direction, dealing lethal damage to any player hit.
* <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/priory/hurlspear.webp"/>
* **Savage Mauling** - The boss will leap towards a random player, rooting them in place and dealing moderate damage to them over time. He will gain a shield during this time, and the shield must be broken to free the player from the root and damage.
* <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/priory/savagemauling.webp"/>
* **Battle Cry** - An interruptible cast that deals high damage to the entire group and increases his and his companion's damage by 50%, as well as granting them half of their energy bar.  Missing this kick is almost certainly a wipe.

**Taener Duelmal**

* **Fireball** - An interruptible cast that he spams, deals moderate damage to a random player.
* **Cinderblast** - This is a moderate, interruptible cast that deals high damage to the tank, stunning them with a magic debuff. This can be dispelled in the worst case, but it should always be kicked.
* **Ember Storm** - At full energy, the boss channels over several seconds, spawning a barrage of swirlies that deal lethal damage to any player caught.
* <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/priory/emberstorm.webp"/>

**Strategy**

* Tank both bosses together. Even though you do not need to kill **Taener**, this makes it simpler for kicks and for any player that gains funnel. Though, of course, everyone will cleave anyways.
* The tank should simply have active mitigation and be topped for each **Pierce Armor**.
* One player should dedicate themselves to interrupting **Battle Cry**, and another to **Cinderblast**.  All other players can freely kick **Fireballs**, though one should perhaps keep their interrupt saved for a backup on either cast.
* Positioning of everyone else generally does not matter, although I recommend ranged stand close to the boss in case of an overlap with **Savage Mauling** and **Ember Storm.** If the boss leaps far out of range of everyone, it can make breaking the shield take to long, and thus the ranged player might be rooted in a swirlie and be killed with little counterplay.
* The player who kicks **Battle Cry** should ideally have a ranged kick, as this can overlap with **Ember Storm** swirlies forcing you out of melee.

Defeating this boss sets the instance respawn location to the steps of the Cathedral itself.

# Trash to Baron Braunpyke

You will not have to travel far to engage the second boss, and must clear the entirety of the Cathedral foyer to spawn him.

After the very first pack, defeating the left side will cause a pack to descend from the stairs on the left. Defeating the right side will cause a pack to descend from the stairs on the right.

* **Ardent Paladin** - These have two abilities--**Consecration**, which places a high damage field under their location, and **Sacred Toll**, which deals a high amount of damage to the entire group.
* <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/priory/consecration.webp"/>
* **Devout Priests and Fanatical Conjurors are retained from the first area**
* **Zealous Templar** - These melee quite hard and cast **Seal of Light's Fury**, increasing their attack speed and granting them holy damage on hit, and **Templar's Wrath**, increasing all damage done by 30% for 10 seconds. Both are non-interruptible and instant.
* **Arathi Neophyte** - These are cannon fodder mobs that melee relatively hard.

# Baron Braunpyke

This is on paper a quite simple boss, but is complicated by tuning and becomes quite difficult if handled incorrectly.

* **Hammer of Purity** - The boss spawns several rotating **Hammers** at the location of a random player, preferring DPS and ranged. When empowered by **Vindictive Wrath**, this targets all five players. These hammers expand their orbit outwards with each revolution.
* <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/priory/hammerofpurity.webp"/>
* **Sacrificial Pyre** - Similar to the last boss of **Tazavesh - So'leah's Gambit**, the boss will spawn a pool of holy energy that lasts for 30 seconds.  At the end of these 30 seconds, the pool will explode, afflicting the party with stacks of **Sacrificial Flame** equal to the amount of charges remaining. A player can touch the pool to expend a charge, shrinking it and instead dealing a moderate amount of damage to the entire group and afflicting only themselves with a stack of **Sacrificial Flame**. This has 3 charges typically, and grows to 5 charges during **Vindictive Wrath**.
* <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/priory/sacrificialpyre.webp"/>
* **Castigator's Shield** - **Braunpyke** will throw shields at the location of several players, which after several moments detonates to deal lethal damage and slowing any players caught.
* <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/priory/castigatorshield.webp"/>
* **Vindictive Wrath** - **Braunypke** empowers himself, increasing his physical damage done by 25% and modifying his abilities.

**Strategy**

* Ranged should stack around 30 yards away from melee and move together, returning to the stack for each **Hammer of Purity**.
* **Castigator's Shield** will generally target melee, and they just need to move out of it and back in to their original spot.
* Outside of **Vindictive Wrath**, 1-2 players can handle the **Sacrificial Pyre**, clearing it as the party health allows. During **Vindictive Wrath**, the tank and any other players should help clear it, and defensives should be used here as the damage can get quite extreme.
* There will be significantly more hammers to dodge during **Vindictive Wrath**, and more movement in general. Remaining as grouped as possible is the best way to stay alive as well as judicious use of defensives and movement.

# Trash to Prioress Murrpray

This is in general the sketchiest area of all Season 2 dungeons. However, you will be forced to pull aggressively in order to time the dungeon. There are several patrolling mobs and packs of dangerous mobs, and it is very easy to accidentally pull packs you did not want to do together. Once you are in the final boss's room, you should LoS pull many of them back into the corridor that you climbed to reach it.

* **Ardent Paladins, Zealous Templars, and Devout Priests are retained from previous areas**.
* **Risen Footman** - These melee and emit **Light Expulsion** on death, which deals moderate damage to the entire group. Too many of these dying together can result in massive amounts of unavoidable damage that can easily combo people unawares.
* **Lightspawn** - These melee and cast **Purification**, a non-interruptible spell that does high damage over 6 seconds. This can be disrupted mid-cast with stops and it will not re-cast. When low on health, they will cast **Burst of LIght**, dealing lethal damage in a radius around themselves as well as healing all allies in that same radius for 35% HP. This can be disrupted with stops, but it also results in the death of the **Lightspawn**.
* <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/priory/burstoflight.webp"/>
* **Risen Mage** - These also emit **Light Expulsion**, dealing moderate damage to the entire group on death and cast **Fireball**, dealing moderate damage to a random target. This is interruptible.

A mini-boss sits in the middle of this room, accompanied by two **Devout Priests**

* **Sir Braunpyke** - He has two abilities--**Radiant Flame**, which is a passive aura that simply deals damage every 0.5 seconds to the party, resulting in an incredible amount of unavoidable damage that must be healed through, and **Blazing Strike**, a light attack on the tank that applies a light DoT.  When he dies, he also emits a **Light Expulsion**, which can finish off any party members that are low.

# Prioress Murrpray

As of writing, the reigning hardest boss of Season 2 dungeons.  Even through several nerfs this is a challenging and brutal encounter due to rather unfortunate tuning.

* **Holy Smite** - **Murrpray** will spam this on the current target, dealing light damage to them. It is interruptible but only truly threatening during **Inner Fire**.
* **Holy Flame** - The boss will call down a beam of light at a player's location, which strikes after several seconds to do lethal damage to anyone in the indicated area.
* <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/priory/holyflame.webp"/>
* **Purify** - **Murrpray** selects a target and tracks them with a laser over several seconds, dealing lethal damage to them if caught by it. It also leaves pools of **Sanctified Ground** as it moves, which deal high ticking damage to anyone inside.
* <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/priory/purify.webp"/>
* **Inner Fire** - **Murrpray** empowers herself for 10 seconds, increasing all holy damage done by 50%. While empowered, she also pulses moderate damage.
* **Blinding Light** - After a short, non-interruptible cast, she deals moderate damage to the entire group, disorienting any players facing her at its completion. You must face away from her to avoid this effect.
* <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/priory/blindinglight.webp"/>
* **Embrace the Light** - At 50% HP, she'll ascend above the stairway to the alcove overlooking **Hallowfall**. She'll then place a large absorb on herself and pulse damage until interrupted, but the shield prevents her from being interrupted. This damage increases every second she continues to channel.
* <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/priory/embracethelight.webp"/>
* **Arathi Neophyte** - After casting **Embrace the Light**, she will summon waves of **Neophytes** for the rest of the encounter. These fixate on random players and attempt to melee them. They are also empowered with **Overwhelming Power**, gaining 50% damage and dealing incredibly high damage to any players within 4 yards.
* <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/priory/neophyte.webp"/>
* **Stoke the Flame** - The **Prioress** places **Sacred Flame** below the alcove, making it impossible for players to fight her below there or on the stairs.

**Strategy**

* As mentioned all the way back in the introductory paragraphs, you will not want many melee as this fight is nigh unplayable for them in the second phase, as of current tuning.
* Ranged should stand along the edges of the arena to bait the **Purify**, and run it so that it covers as little space as possible.  They may stand spread out otherwise to reduce movement when **Holy Flames** come out.
* Turn around during **Blinding Light**, and remain wary of this cast if you are kiting **Purify**.
* The first part of the fight is relatively lax, but the second phase is where things begin getting extreme.
* All players should ascend on the same set of stairs and begin burning the shield as soon as possible.  You should lust at this point and pop CDs.
* Ranged should stand generally together now on the same side to bait the **Neophytes** into a funnel.  Melee, including the tank, should be **extremely careful** when assisting in killing and cc'ing the **Neophytes**.
* **Blinding Light** and **Purify** will overlap much more often in this second half of the fight, and you will need to be careful to manage your space properly.
* **Neophytes are the absolute highest priority while they are alive**.

# Routing and Lust Recommendations

This is the order in which you should Lust:

1. First Pull
2. Big pull after first boss, or **Baron Braunpyke**
3. **Prioress Murrpray P2**

Here is the route I recommend for early in the season, and for PUGs.

Here is the route I recommend for more advanced groups.

# Skips

Listed here are demonstrations of any pertinent skips I am currently aware of.

* None as of now

# Profession or Dungeon Buffs

* **Blessing of the Sacred Flame** - May be activated by **Priests** and **Paladins** at various **Braziers** throughout the instance and this buff fades on death. Has been nerfed as of writing to be about a 1% damage increase overall, and should not be a significant factor in your composition choice.
