title: A Complete Preview for the Chrome King Gallywix
---

*The following is entirely speculation from the dungeon journal and the very brief snapshots we have seen of the boss room.  It is likely mostly wrong, but also mostly right. You should walk away from this more confused than when you began.*

The fight against Gallywix is a multi-stage, highly technical encounter that will stress your raid's ability to coordinate and move as a unit throughout. It revolves around sabotaging the Giga Coils around the encounter space by using the Giga bombs dropped by adds you can defeat during the fight and dealing with the various Cannisters used. By using Gallywix's inventions against him, you can turn the tide and defeat him, putting an end to the Chrome King's reign and stopping him from unleashing his twisted weaponry against his own people.

# Important Abilities

As you can tell, there's a lot of abilities in this fight. We'll break it down by each phase.

**Phase One**

* **Scatterblast Cannisters** - **Gallywix** fires a blast at his current tank, inflicting a massive amount of damage to them. This portion cannot be dodged or parried. **Additionally**, this also blasts players in a frontal cone centered on the tank (presumably moving with them), dealing a massive amount of damage (28M on 10H, scaling) but split between all players struck. **This also increases their damage taken from this ability by 100% for 30 seconds**.  All targets hit become afflicted with **Mechengineer's Cannisters**. If this fails to hit at least 3 players, this will instead hit all players for the full, unsplit damage, resulting in a wipe.
* **Mechengineer's Cannisters** - A healing absorb placed on those who soaked the **Scatterblast Cannister**, which lasts for 30 seconds. Upon expiration or being fully consumed, this will deal damage to the player based on how much was left in the absorb. **On Heroic**, this deals damage to the entire raid based on how much was left.  Presumably, if it's consumed, it will deal no damage. If it is not healed whatsoever, it does the full amount of the absorb to all players for each person not healed.
* **Big Bad Buncha Bombs** - This is one ability, but has several components to it.  The first is the main ordnance, which is a rain of artillery that deals lethal damage to any players caught in the indicated visuals. Any players hit by any of these components receive **Blast Burns**, a stacking, light damage but long-lasting (45 seconds) DoT.
* **Bad Belated Boom** - The next component of **Big Bad Buncha Bombs**. Several of the bombs had out-of-compliance safety fuses, causing them to detonate late.  These inflict moderate damage to players within the indicated 7-yard radius, and applies **Blast Burns**.
* **Sapper's Satchels** - The third component of **Big Bad Buncha Bombs**. Several players will be marked, exploding after 5 seconds for light damage.  Any players within 7 yards when these detonate receive that damage, **Blast Burns** AND **Sapper's Satchels**. **On Heroic**, when the marked players detonate, they also drop a pile of bombs at their feet, which explode moments later dealing moderate damage.
* **1500-Pound DUD** - **On Heroic**, an unknown amount of munitions will embed themselves into the arena, exploding after 15 seconds for high damage to the entire raid and applying a high damage DoT that stacks. A player can instead interact with this ordnance to focus the blast, similar to **Z'skarn**, instead taking 10 Million damage and knocking them back. The player who triggers this will also receive **Focused Detonation**, a high damage DoT that lasts 10 seconds.  Lastly, shortly after **Focused Detonation** expires, a **Time-Release Crackle** blasts throughout the arena, dealing light damage to the raid.
* **Zagging Zizzlers** - Miniature rockets fly about the various piles, dealing light damage to the raid for 30 seconds. This stacks.
* **Suppression** - **Gallywix** shrapnels players in indicated locations for 3 seconds, inflicting light damage on impact and then afflicting players hit with a light DoT that stacks every 0.5 seconds they remain in the location.
* **Venting Heat** - **Gallywix's** machines dump excess heat, burning all players in the arena, dealing a light burst of damage up-front then very light damage over 4 seconds. Every time he casts this, the next cast is 1 second longer due to the inefficiency of his invention's heat dissipation.
* **Gatling Cannon** - Instead of melee'ing, **Gallywix** shoots his main target, dealing up to 200% increased damage based on how far they are from him.
* **Trick Shots** - **Gallywix** gains this buff every 4 seconds, stacking. If he reaches 10 stacks of this **OR** if his main target changes, he will release all stacks, dealing 2.5 Million physical damage plus a ~400k a second DoT per stack that lasts 9 seconds.  This cannot be dodged.

**Phase Two**

**Gallywix** retains much of the abilities from **Phase One**, like **Big Bad Buncha Bombs and all related components, Suppression, and Venting Heat**, but **Scatterblast Cannisters** has been modified, and he now summons additional adds and makes use of the **Giga Coils** that surround the arena.

* **Giga Coils** - **Gallywix** charges and activates one of the **Giga Coils** around the room, causing moderate ticking damage every second.  **On Heroic**, this also causes **Overloaded Bolts**, creating swirlies to dodge that cause light damage in indicated locations.
* **Giga Blast** - **Gallywix** collects the power of the **Giga Coils** and ejects it in a direction, several times, dealing moderate damage to anyone struck and also afflicting them with a light, stacking DoT.  Each successive blast increases **Giga Coil** damage by 15%.
* **Giga BOOM!** - **Giga Bombs** detonate after 30 seconds or when struck by **Giga Blast**, inflicting moderate damage to the raid plus a light DoT that ticks every second for 9 seconds. This stacks per explosion.
* **Sabotaged Controls** - When both **Giga Controls** on a **Giga Coil** are damaged, they spark occasionally, dealing light damage to targeted players every 6 seconds per each **Sabotaged Control**.
* **Control Meltdown** - Sabotaging a **Giga Controls** causes this for 1 minute. If **Gallywix** attempts to cast **Giga Coils** during this time, it backfires, interrupting the cast.
* **Sabotage Zone** - When both **Giga Controls** on a **Giga Coil** are damaged, this covers their quadrant of the room, dealing moderate damage every second to players in the area.
* **Fused Cannisters** - **Gallywix** marks several players and launches shells at them that detonate after 6 seconds. Upon detonation, this deals light damage, split evenly among everyone in an 8 yard radius.  All targets who soak this receive **Mechengineer's Cannisters**, the same effect from **Phase One** and working similarly, exploding for damage to the player equal to the healing absorb remaining. **On Heroic**, this deals damage to the whole raid instead, just as in **Phase One**.  Any marked player who fails to share this effect with at least 1 other player causes this to instead affect the entire raid for the full effect.
* **Darkfuse Technician** - These arrive in on a **Party Crashing Rocket**, dealing light damage to any players within the indicated visual on impact.  These do not do much, except **Juice It!**, which charges a **Giga Bomb**, causing it to explode for light damage in a 10 yard radius and increase their damage and movement speed by 5%, stacking. These drop **Charged Giga Bombs** on death. 
* **Giga Bomb** - These are dropped by **Darkfuse Technicians** on death, and radiate very light damage in a 3 yard radius. They can be picked up by players, instead focusing that damage to them. A player carrying this **Bomb** can choose to **Fling Giga Bomb**, throwing it to a targeted location.  Carrying this near a **Giga Controls** causes **Giga Bomb Detonation**, inflicting a jolt to the player carrying the **Bomb** and sabotaging the **Controls**. This jolt also gives the player 30% movement speed for 10 seconds.
* **Sharpshot Sentry** - These cast **Shock Barrage** at a random player, an interruptible channel that deals high damage over 4 seconds.
* **Darkfuse Wrenchmonger** - These arrive in on a **Party Crashing Rocket**, dealing light damage to any players within the indicated visual on impact. These can be tanked and deal high damage with **Wrench**, which debuffs their main target with every cast, increasing their damage taken from **Wrench** by 40% a stack.  They also enrage with **Lumbering Rage**, gaining 50% damage but 50% reduced movement speed.
**Intermission**
* **Cratering** - **Gallywix** slams down into the arena, dealing massive (and certainly lethal) damage to any players within 20 yards of the impact, and moderate damage to the entire raid.
* **Armageddon-Class Plating** - A shield from the **Darkfuse** that prevents **Gallywix** from being interrupted. 
* **Radiant Electricity** - **On Heroic**, **Gallywix** rotates a beam of lightning that stuns and deals moderate damage to any player caught.  
* **Total Destruction** - **Gallywix** rains down rockets on the entire raid, causing light damage that increases by 20% with every tick, lasting 30 seconds. 

**Phase Three**

**Gallywix** retains a mix of abilities from **Phase Two**, with some modifications to make them more deadly. He no longer summons **Sharpshot Sentries** or **Darkfuse Wrenchmongers**, however. **Fused Cannisters** have become **Tick-Tock Cannisters**. Several abilities from **Big Bad Buncha Bombs** have also seen modification, and **Suppression** has a new effect.

* **Big Badder Bomb Blast** - **Gallywix** shells his primary target with this, inflicting moderate damage to them anyone with 30 yards. This also causes anyone hit to take 200% increased damage for 1.5 minutes. Anyone hit also receives **Blast Burns**.
* **Overloaded Rockets** - **Sapper's Satchel** is removed in exchange for this ability.  This attaches rockets to several players, causing them to shoot out a barrage of rockets in indicated directions, inflicting a massive DoT to anyone hit as well as knocking them back.
* **Tick-Tock Cannisters** - **Gallywix** ejects volatile cannisters around the arena which embed themselves into the floor.  These detonate after 5 seconds, dealing light damage, split amongst all players soaking each one. All targets hit are afflicted with **Mechengineer's Cannisters**, once again causing the same effect from **Phase One and Two**. If any of these fail to hit at least a single player, it instead affects the entire raid with their effect per unsoaked **Cannister**.
* **Gallywix Finale Burst** - **Gallywix** finishes **Suppression** with pizzazz, firing a larger shock at a targeted location that deals lethal damage to all players, but is reduced by distance from the epicenter.
* **Ego Check** - **On Heroic** this replaces **Trick Shots**, causing **Gallywix** instead to deal a 4-hit combo that deals moderate damage with each strike. This cannot be dodged or parried, and 90% of the unmitigated damage is dealt as a DoT called **Checked Ego** that lasts 22 seconds, and it can stack.

# Strategy (Normal and Heroic)

It will be difficult to provide a working strategy without knowing exactly how the **Giga Coils** and **Giga Controls** work. From the wording of the dungeon journal, I assume each **Giga Controls** requires 2 **Giga Bomb Detonations** for it to break. The wording of the **Giga Coils** cast itself is also strange, as this would cause incredibly heavy raid damage in addition to all the other effects going on.  For now, we'll assume the following:  The **Giga Coils** cast simply causes a set of **Coils** to radiate damage until interrupted, but **Giga Blast** will occur even if it is interrupted.  Also, only one set of **Giga Coils** will activate at once, unless the mechanic is not done correctly and **Gallywix** is able to activate another set.  This seems to be the case as the **Overview** section states he casts this as full energy.  We will also assume that multiple **Darkfuse Technicians** spawn at a time, and so you need 2 players to fully destroy the **Giga Controls**. However, it may be possible that **Gallywix** casts this often enough that you will want to delay fully destroying a **Giga Controls** set until necessary, in order to keep the room from being eaten up by **Sabotage Zones**.

Also, we will assume that in the intermission, the abilities are used multiple times, as the **Armageddon Class Plating** shield amount seems incredibly under-tuned otherwise.

Lastly, we will assume that in **Phase One and Two** the boss is stationary, as otherwise the description text for **Phases Two and Three** makes little sense.

**Phase One**
* The simplest phase, as there are no **Giga Coils** to deal with.  You will want two teams to rotate through soaking the **Scatterblast Cannisters**.  **Evens** first, **Odds** second is a tale as old as time, and will be the simplest way to deal with this.
* You will need a large healing cooldown to heal off the healing absorb for each one of these **Cannister** soaks. The boss is stationary, but for the least movement required you can have each team stack with their tank and simply have the tanks taunt for each soak so no one has to worry about not being in the right spot.
* As this soak may overlap with other abilities, it may also be helpful to set static soak points so that players can dodge/bait mechanics away, then return to those areas for their soak.
* During the **Big Bad Buncha Bombs**, you will want the raid to spread a fair bit away from each other to give room for dodging. For **Sapper's Satchels**, players should dodge to the sides of the arena for this, especially on **Heroic**, so that there is little chance of complicating movement for others.  Anyone who *doesn't* have the **Satchels** should dodge towards the middle of the arena.
* **On Heroic**, tanks and players with immunities should soak the **1500 Pound DUD** as soon as they can, but try to do so in a staggered fashion, so that the **Time-Release Crackles** don't occur all at once.
* **Tanks** can swap for **Trick Shots** around 5-7 stacks or just swap for each **Scatterblast Cannister**, whichever occurs first.
* There will likely be an overlap where there will be a **Scatterblast**->**Big Bad Buncha Bombs**->**Suppression**->**Venting Heat**, causing an incredible amount of raid damage while requiring a great deal of movement. This is where raid CDs and personals should be used, as well as movement CDs.

**Phase Two**

* From this point on, the fight becomes about managing the **Giga Coils** and preventing them from dealing their massive damage to the raid.  However, you must make certain that you balance this while keeping the play space open for play. For now, we will assume that you must bring 2 **Giga Bombs** to the **Controls** for each **Giga Coils**, but keep in mind that you may be able to simply do 1 **Giga Bomb** at a time to keep the area as open as you can for as long as possible.
* You should have players assigned to pick up **Giga Bombs**, although anyone who understands the mechanic can feel free to do it. Players carrying **Giga Bombs** should be careful not to be struck by the **Giga Blast**, as this will not only damage them, but destroy the bomb, possibly preventing the raid from stopping the **Giga Coil** cast, likely causing a wipe.
* The tank not currently tanking should pick up the **Darkfuse Wrenchmonger** and any other adds and bring them to the boss for cleave. The tank who has **Gallywix** can assist in this as well as needed.  The **Wrench** stacks should not be a great concern on these difficulties, and worst case you may simply need to pop something. These should be cleaved down.
* Players should make certain to interrupt the **Sharpshot Sentries**, as their **Shock Barrage** cast can combo a player taking damage from other mechanics.
* In general, during a **Fused Cannisters**, players should try to loosely stack together so that pairs of players can be found as soon as possible. Should this overlap during a **Big Bad Buncha Bombs**, it will be quite difficult to manage finding a partner with not stacking with a player with **Sapper's Satchels.** It is good to keep in mind the previous rule, in which I recommend that players with **Sapper's Satchels** should move towards the *outside*, and everyone else should move *inside*.

**Intermission**

* As mentioned, we will assume that these abilities will be cast multiple times due to how undertuned **Armageddon Class Plating** is.
* You will need some sort of movement speed for every **Cratering**, ideally.
* Players should make certain to stay as grouped as possible for healing while breaking the shield, and on **Heroic** should also care for the **Radiant Electricity** beam.

**Phase Three**

* This plays much the same as **Phase Two**, with some slight changes.
* Players with the **Overloaded Rockets** should still follow the same pattern of dodging out of the raid towards the outside, and they should in general try to go to certain areas to make it so the **Rockets** all come from the same general area.
* When the **Suppression** happens on **Heroic**, you should ideally have players bait the final blast as far from the raid as possible to minimize movement, but if it is not controllable in that fashion then you will simply need to make a large movement away from it.
* Movement should be saved for the **Tick-Tock Cannisters**, so that players can get to a soak in time. Players should simply get to a **Cannister** and plant. Make it so that if another player sees you, they can simply focus on getting to a different **Cannister**.
* The tank who receives the **Bigger Badder Bomb Blast** should move to a far off location to explode. As this actually does not deal that much damage, each tank can probably take 2 stacks each before needing to swap, although it is not known if the debuff will refresh each time. For now, alternate taking each one.
* **Ego Check** is also not that much damage, and each tank can probably take multiple, depending on what they are comfortable with and what they have after soaking the bombs.  For now, I would simply recommend swapping on each **Ego Check**.
* Towards the end of the encounter, you will have much less space for dealing with all of the above, and there should be a much greater focus on player's baiting properly.  Tanks may also take the **Bigger Badder Bomb Blast** into the **Sabotage Zones** as space dictates.

# Mythic Changes

It is assumed that there will be a mythic only phase as of this writing, and so we do not know the full breadth of all the changes on mythic. However, there are changes we can see in the dungeon journal for now.

* The encounter begins in **Phase Three**, but also has the **Darkfuse Wrenchmongers** from **Phase Two** instead of just the **Technicians**.
* The **Cannisters** have now become **Combination Cannisters**, doing a mix of **Fused Cannisters** and **Tick-Tock Cannisters**.  This means you will need players to not only find partners for their soak, but also soak the embedded **Cannisters** in the ground, further complicating movement in between all other mechanics.
* **Darkfuse Technicians** are now **Giga Juiced Technicians**, and have new abilities such as **Ionization** a debuff it places on random players that can be dispelled and **Static Zap**, an interruptible cast on a random player that deals damage and stuns them for 4 seconds.
* **Darkfuse Wrenchmongers** **Lumbering Rage** now increases their damage by 500%, likely requiring the tank to kite them if this is not dispellable.
* **Giga Bombs** now start as **Discharged Giga Bombs**, and thus do not detonate until they are **Charged**.  
* Any **Giga Bombs**, charged or not, trigger **Auto-Locking Cuffs** 0.5 seconds after pickup.  This prevents players from using **Fling Giga Bomb** or from picking up additional **Giga Bombs**.  If this aura removes for any reason **OTHER** than a **Giga Bomb Detonation**, it detonates, dealing lethal damage to the entire raid.
* **Control Meltdown**, which interrupts **Giga Coils**, now only lasts 15 seconds, forcing players to protect the **Giga Bombs** for a much longer time. This is in addition to **Giga Bombs** now also taking 3.5 minutes to detonate, up from 30 seconds.
* **Giga Blast** now leaves **Giga Blast Residue** behind for 21 seconds. This either charges a **Discharged Giga Bomb** if a player carrying one comes into contact with it, or stuns a player not holding one for 8 seconds and deals light damage to them. Either effect will consume this **Residue**.
* **Giga Bomb Detonation** also deals damage to the control based on the health of the bomb, likely referring to the amount of charge it has. This means you may need several **Giga Blast Residue** to fully charge a bomb.
* In the intermission, several players, and any players between them and the boss, will be tethered to **Gallywix**, dealing a light amount of damage to them that quickly increases to a large amount of damage based on how far they are from **Gallywix**.

# Mythic Strategy

* The entirety of **Phase One** of mythic now revolves around protecting and charging **Giga Bombs.** Any player that picks these up and dies with them for any reason will wipe the raid. You must also now charge each **Bomb** potentially multiple times before you can actually blow up the **Giga Controls**. You must also time sabotaging the **Giga Controls** so that **Giga Coils** will actually be cast while they are in a state of **Meltdown**.
* Depending on how many **Technicians** spawn, it is possible you may need to only partially charge some **Bombs** simply to get them off of the arena before they can detonate, if you end up with an excess.
* Adds become a much higher priority as each is in general much more dangerous.  
* It is not known when exactly the **Intermission** actually occurs at now. This also requires far more strict positioning, likely with all players now needing to spread out into their own designated locations for movement during this part of the fight.

# Notes on Healing

Like **Mug'Zee**, there is far more healing required in this fight than all the others. There is constant rot throughout, with moments of high burst damage to the raid, spot healing, and triage. Almost all healing profiles will be seen throughout this encounter.

The raid will alternate being stacked and spread, and understanding these moments will be at the core of you properly healing this encounter.  There will also be moments of high movement at which you will also need to do a large amount of healing.  For each **Big Bad Buncha Bombs**, you should factor in this movement and be ready for it and have a plan for how best to do your healing during it.

# Notes on Tanking

Boss positioning will be quite important throughout this encounter. For the moment, we will assume **Gallywix** will activate the nearest **Giga Coil**, giving you some control over where the fight occurs at.  **On Heroic**, you also have a greater responsibility in the **1500 Pound DUDs**, which require you to go out and clean them up while you are not tanking the boss.  You need to do your best to keep the boss in a clean area for the melee, and make certain adds are picked up and brought to be cleaved down.

# Defensive Usage

Defensives are best utilized during the **Scatterblast Cannisters** in **Phase One**, if you receive a **Sapper's Satchel** in any phase, during the **Big Bad Buncha Bombs** or if a **Giga Coils** is allowed to persist for some time.  

# Movement Cooldowns

Movement Cooldowns will be very impactful in this encounter. You will want to use them, for the most part, during the **Big Bad Buncha Bombs** to aid in properly spreading out **Sapper's Satchels** and **Overloaded Rockets**, or for the **Fused/Tick-Tock Cannisters**.

# Damage Profile Best Suited for this Encounter

As of this moment, this does seem to be another encounter where Single Target with efficient cleave is best. As we do not know how many adds will spawn, it is difficult to estimate how much cleave and potentially AoE is necessary, but Single Target will still be king as of now.
