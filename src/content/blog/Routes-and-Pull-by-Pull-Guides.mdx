title: Routes and Pull-by-Pull Guides
---

Hey all,

Still cleaning stuff up. I'll leaf through everything on my phone and completely forget what guide had that glaring typo, but most of them have been whacked down.  I'm gathering all the last minute minutiae like skips and whatnot and hopefully I won't have missed too many.

As Keystone.guru has published all the S2 routes, I'll be including those at the end of the Dungeon Guides (in the "Routing and Lust Recommendations" section, I believe it's called), but I realized that even then, for tanks especially, you might want a companion guide explaining the pulls.

So I'll be putting those together as well!

It'll mostly be text for now. Lots of gaming this week (Fellowship, Monster Hunter Wilds), so I just won't have time to waste in Premiere cutting stuff together, sorry.  Towards the end of the week I'll be doing my last minute personal review of the fights and planning CDs and whatnot and will probably include my thought process on that per boss for anyone that's interested.
