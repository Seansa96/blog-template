Patch 11.2 introduces **K'aresh**, the original home of the **Ethereal** and the **Brokers**, which was destroyed by <details><summary>Spoilers</summary>the ruling council of the K'areshi, the Ravel</details> **Dimensius, the All-Devouring** attacking their world almost a hundred-thousand years ago.

In **K'aresh**, you can find the standard new-patch-island fare: a story campaign, a new Renown, several different types of World Events, and cosmetic rewards aplenty.

This overview will function as both an introduction to the various systems, as well as a guide and reference for all that you may be interested in.

# Reshii Wraps and the Story Campaign

Shortly upon logging in to the new Season, whether you're there week 1 or week 20, if you've completed the requisite quests (<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=20597/the-war-within#comments">if you've earned this achievement, basically</a>), you should get the quest <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/quest=84956/a-shadowy-invitation" class="wowhead">A Shadowy Invitation</a>, which will begin the campaign
and see you travel to **K'aresh**, using **Tazavesh** as the base of operations and main hub for the zone.

After a relatively short campaign that should take **about an hour and change**, you'll be given the **Reshii Wraps**, introduced to **Phase Diving**, and at this point you can either choose to leave the zone and do whatever you fancy or begin restoring the world of **K'aresh** to its former glory.

I'll give a brief overview of the **Reshii Wraps** here however, and pretty much everything you need to know about it.

## Reshii Wraps

In patch 11.2, there are no other cloaks that you can obtain, and instead you will use this **Artifact** quality item for the rest of the **War Within**, presumably.

* This item does not have secondary stats, and instead has a single socket for **Fibers**, and a special, spec/role specific effect that automatically adapts to your current specialization.

* For tanks, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1217096/ethereal-protection" class="wowhead">it's a moderate absorb that also functions as a very weak "Cheat Death" effect, with a 6 minute cooldown</a>.
* For DPS, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1217101/ethereal-reaping" class="wowhead">it's a rather strong damage proc that has execute scaling</a>
* For healers <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1217103/ethereal-reconstitution" class="wowhead">it's a rather solid random healing proc</a>.

To obtain the **Fibers**, which are just a single secondary stat that you can pick, you'll get a free **rare** quality one shortly after acquiring the cloak, and then will be able to purchase others from the vendor <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/npc=241588/hashim" class="wowhead">**Hashim**</a> for a measly sum of **100 Gold**.

However, for epic quality **Fibers**, which grant significantly more secondary stat, you'll need a **Tailor** who can craft them, and thus will need to submit a work order if you do not have that profession yourself.

The current crafting reagents for this are: 
* **5 Adorning Ribbons**
* **2 Gleaming Shards**
* **5 Exquisite Weavercloth Bolts**.

There are **Fibers** for all 4 secondary stats, but again, *you can only choose a single secondary stat for your cloak*.

You may be wondering if the item level of the cloak itself can be increased.  It can, and this is with a time-gated currency called <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/currency=3278/ethereal-strands" class="wowhead">**Ethereal Strands**, available from nearly all forms of content.</a>.

There is an associated upgrade tree associated with the **Reshii Wraps** where you can see your current **Warband** progress on your **Reshii Wraps** and deposit the **Strands** into the nodes.  With each upgrade on the tree, your cloak will rise in rank, and correspondingly in item level, all the way up to item level 730.

It should take approximately 5 weeks to unlock all nodes, but it is a rolling cap, allowing players to grind all the way up to the current region-wide cap if they are behind. 

***Again, progress is Warband-wide, meaning you can automatically level up the nodes on other characters without having to acquire Strands on them.**


# Side-quests

There are **11** quest-chains separated from the main campaign, which rewarded **as of most recent testing**, a varying amount of renown, from 350 to 500, to 2000.

These are sources of one-time renown, and thus should be completed at least once if you desire the maximum amount of renown.

All storylines can be found here, within the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/achievement=42739/sojourner-of-karesh" class="wowhead">**Sojourner of K'aresh**</a>achievement.

I have listed the starting quest and quest-giver location for each here for quick reference:

# Phase Diving

This is the main "gimmick" of **K'aresh**, similar to **D.R.I.V.E.** in **Undermine**.

This allows you to use the **Reshii Wraps** to transition to a higher energy state, allowing you to both recognize and interact with an entirely different spectrum of the physical world called "*The Untethered*".

While in *The Untethered*, you can only interact with creatures that exist and operate within it, and initially will not be able to mount, instead moving at 150% of regular movement speed.

Through upgrading your **Reshii Wraps**, you'll be able to mount your land mounts, but will never be able to fly. Instead, for navigation between the isolated regions of **K'aresh**, and for overall "fast travel", you can use the various **Phase Conduits** located around **K'aresh**. 

Like flight masters, to use these, you must "discover" them first, but afterwards these will allow you relatively unrestricted and instant access to most parts of **K'aresh**, and this is the fastest method of travel in the zone.

You can only enter *The Untethered* from **Phase Conduits**, but can exit it at any time by simply right-clicking the buff off of your character, or using any of the items that allow you to do so.


# Ecological Succession

This is another one of the main features of **K'aresh**, focusing around the restoration of the **Eco-Dome** at **The Oasis**.  

After a short quest-line available after completing the first 4 chapters of the **K'aresh** Campaign, you'll be able to introduce new wild-life every week into the **Eco-Dome**.

While this is mainly for cosmetics, a small amount of renown with the **K'areshi Trust** can be earned here every week, that amount increasing with every new expert you bring into the fold.

This is **Warband-wide**, so you only need do the quest-line once to unlock the various wildlife for all of your characters.

# Warrants

These are weekly quests offered by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/npc=238255/constable-zoardaz" class="wowhead">**Constable Zo'ardaz**</a> to hunt down and summon rares within **K'aresh** in return for a moderate amount of renown with the **K'areshi Trust**.

They involve you gathering a set of materials to lure out the target rare, usually by completing 2-3 quests to obtain that specific material.  After that, you'll craft the lure item and then can right-click on it to start a quest to summon and defeat that rare, and then afterwards can turn it back in to <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/npc=238255/constable-zoardaz" class="wowhead">**Constable Zo'ardaz**</a>.

Currently, only one **Warrant** is offered each week at a time.

# Devourer Invasions

The last real "feature" of the zone, these are just random world events that occur every 15-30 minutes which see you fill a bar and then kill a **Devourer** elite.  

The main reason to do this weekly is for your **Ecological Succession** weekly quest, in which you can obtain <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/search?q=crystallized+anima" class="wowhead">**Crystallized Anima**</a> quick 20% contribution towards its completion.

There is also a mount that can be earned by killing each rare once a week, which rewards the player with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=246240/devoured-energy-pod" class="wowhead">**Devoured Energy-Pods**</a>. There are 4 rares, and thus 4 of these **Pods** can be acquired each week, resulting in a 5 week grind for the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=246159/translocated-gorger" class="wowhead">**Translocated Gorger** mount</a>.

# Weekly Checklist for Renown

This is what you should make sure you do every week in order to acquire the maximum possible amount of renown with the new faction, the **K'areshi Trust**.

* Pick up the weekly dungeon quest in **Dornogal** and complete it, choosing the **K'areshi Trust** commendation.
* Completing **Bountiful Delves** until you receive the **K'areshi Trust** renown commendation.
* Completing all available **Expert** weekly quests in your **Eco-Dome** at **The Oasis**.
* Completing the **Weekly Warrant**.
* Completing all world quests, preferably with a contract on. You may optionally choose to complete all **Khaz'Algar** and **Undermine** world quests as well with a contract on to maximize reputation, although this is certainly a bit hardcore.
* Killing all rares in the zone, although this is quite minor.
* Complete the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/quest=91093/more-than-just-a-phase" class="wowhead">**More Than Just a Phase**</a> weekly quest.


You should also make sure you complete all available side-quests, collect all <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guide/the-war-within/karesh-zone-unlocking-flying-treasures#kareshi-lore-books">**K'areshi Lore Books**</a>
and any treasures to earn the one-time chunks of renown they provide.
