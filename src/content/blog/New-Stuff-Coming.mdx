title: New Stuff Coming
---

Hey all!

Standard stuff. "Wow, I never saw this coming!" "I'm really grateful to all of you!" Yada yada. You get it, I get it.

Anyways, I'm working to improve the site usability as we speak and should have better loading of images and overall more performant pages for all users by the weekend.  Keystone.guru should also be up soon, and I'll start posting routes for all the dungeons as soon as that's done.

Raidplans are getting last touches as well, and I'm looking at some other minor stuff to include in between all of that.

As tuning is wrapping up on the PTR, I'll also be doing some more dungeons over the weekend and watching some streams to finalize my guides, so you might see some small details change and other stuff get added/removed.  

Also, as a reminder--things change. Day 1, you might see the guides change in real time as I'll be watching any top guilds and ripping their strats if they're any different from mine. I'm fairly confident in the first 5 bosses, but One-Armed Bandit and Mug'Zee will very likely be different than what worked on PTR.

I'll be including a preliminary look at Gallywix as well just so people that want to at least familiarize themselves with the mechanics can do that, though of course the full guide probably won't drop until Day 2 unfortunately, as I raid Tuesdays and will be grinding keys right after raid ends.
