title: A Complete Guide to Fractillus

This is a short but intense throughput-check fight (taking the typical spot of the **"Sludgefist"** encounter), which requires the raid to intelligently manage the placement of crystalline walls, or else risk letting the void energies surrounding them to empower the boss, resulting in their quick demise.

# Abilities

Compared to most bosses, there are relatively few abilities here, with the brunt of the difficulty being the logistical puzzle they present.

* **Entropic Conjunction** - **Fractillus** targets 5 players with this ability, then after several seconds launches a wave of crystalline energy toward them, knocking them back and afflicting them with a heavy DoT, stacking per wave they are hit by.  This wave fully crystallizes upon contacting one of the **Crystal Nexuses** in a lane, forming a wall. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/fractillus/entropiconjunction.webp" />

If 6 of these walls form in a single lane, they extend the power of the void to the boss, empowering him with 200% damage and causing him to **Tantrum** for the rest of the encounter, effectively wiping the raid.

* **Shockwave Slam** - **Fractillus** aims this at his current targeting, firing a concentrated blast of crystalline energy, knocking them back and increasing their damage taken by this ability for one minute. This also forms a wall in the lane they are currently in. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/fractillus/shockwaveslam.webp" />
* **Crystalline Backhand** - The boss selects up to seven players, rooting them after 4 seconds. Shortly after they are rooted, the boss smacks any rooted players  backwards, causing them to each break one wall that they contact. Breaking a wall in this way ejects shrapnel that deals moderate damage to any player struck.  **On Heroic and higher**, some of the walls that form are **Void-Infused**, and also afflict random players with **Nether Corruption**, dealing damage in a small circle around them after a few moments. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/fractillus/crystallinebackhand.webp" />

# Strategy (Normal and Heroic)

As I mentioned, there really isn't many mechanics to deal with here. The difficulty comes from the pacing and logistical management of the arena.

To be frank, the Weakaura pack for the raid will mostly play this fight for you. However, I will still give you a breakdown of the logic behind playing this encounter.

* The raid should all select one lane, ideally central to the encounter space, and play there until the raid leader has elected to move to an adjacent lane, if they deem it necessary.
* When **Entropic Conjunction** goes out, players should simply distribute themselves evenly. There are six lanes, and five players are targeted at a time. Thus, each player must simply get to one of the lanes not occupied by the raid and plant until the boss fires a wall at them
* When **Crystalline Backhand** goes out, you will want to focus on evenly distributing five of the breaks among all walls, then focus the extra breaks on any lane that has accrued more walls than the others.
* The tanks should pick a lane each cycle to focus their walls on, so that the raid can clearly see which lane will need multiple breaks ahead of time. The raid leader should explicitly communicate the needed distribution to avoid any confusion.
* If necessary to extend the fight, players may start using the safe lane towards the end of the fight, and the raid should adjust into a new safe lane.

# Mythic Changes

The changes on mythic are very slight and do not majorly affect the strategy or execution of it.

* New **Infused** walls can now be formed, which afflict all raid members with a heavy DoT when broken.

# Mythic Strategy

Again, the strategy is not changed by this whatsoever. You must now simply be aware of when these new "white" walls will be broken, and simply deal with the extra incoming damage when or if they are broken.

# Notes on Healing

The damage is incredibly scripted and there is no real rot. You should make sure to heal the players with **Conjunction** and be aware of overlaps with **Crystalline Backhand** and **Entropic Conjunction**, and triage heal the players most in danger of dying.  

# Notes on Tanking

As mentioned above, you should communicate with your co-tank on what lanes you will be stacking the tank walls in, and make sure the raid is aware of which lanes will be overloaded in this manner. The boss itself does not hit particularly hard, and you should spend much of your cognitive energy monitoring the status of the lanes.

# Damage Profile Best Suited for this Encounter

This is a completely single target boss, and thus you should aim to do as much single target DPS as possible with the requisite build.
