title: (Updated)Ranking the War Within Season 2 Keys
---

*Revised as of March 3rd. Cinderbrew drops from 7th to 6th. Floodgate moves up to 7th. Priory remains the same but is much easier*

TL;DR - **Easiest to Hardest**

1. **Theater of Pain**
1. **Operation: Mechagon - Workshop**
1. **Darkflame Cleft**
1. **Rookery**
1. **Motherlode**
1. **Cinderbrew Meadery**
1. **Operation: Floodgate**
1. **Priory of the Sacred Flame**

**Theater of Pain - 1**

While more than a few people were wary of this key's return, due to its length and rather unique target profile, this has ended up to be--by a noticeable amount, the easiest key as of current tuning on the PTR.  The bosses are all quite easy and none of them scale particularly poorly besides **Xav**, and the trash is significantly easier overall than the other dungeons. There are some outliers, notably the mini-bosses in the military wing, but combined with a pretty forgiving timer, even as of the latest nerf, it is difficult to brick this key unless you full wipe multiple times.

**Operation: Mechagon - Workshop - 2**

Many of the changes to this dungeon effectively served as overall nerfs to many of the encounters, and while some parts can be sketchy to play at times, the only truly difficult boss in here is the **Machinist**, but in the context of a weekly key, you can be hit by one blade every now and then as long as you're topped without too much trouble.  You *can* lose time in the early weeks from the obstacle courses, specifically the stealth section while people are still learning, but overall this key doesn't really present a whole lot of throughput or mechanical checks.

**Darkflame Cleft - 3**

I almost put this key higher as I believe people will have a hell of a time with the first area of the dungeon in the first week, but the fact of the matter is that when you approach it with any measure of respect, the rest of the dungeon is so easy that it just doesn't matter. **Blazikon** can and will probably trip up some people until they understand exactly how the candles are to be handled, and **Candle King** looms ominously as a monstrous healing check, but again, everything else is just so...easy. As long as you take things slow and steady in the first section and play clean the rest of the way, you should be fine even with a full wipe.

**Rookery - 4**

This used to easily take the spot as the second hardest dungeon, but a few targeted nerfs have massively reduced the intensity of this dungeon and made it a fairly comfortable key to run while also being quite short.  That being said, early on in the season it does have a few things that will easily catch people off-guard, and while the second area's trash has seen massive nerfs/changes, I anticipate it still being a hot-spot of deaths in the first couple of weeks.  The second and third boss can also quite easily go wrong if handled incorrectly, but they are shadows of their former selves.

**Motherlode - 5**

This one was a bit difficult to rank.  Parts of it make me want to put it higher, and parts of it make me question if it really deserves to be there. However, this is a dungeon that will thoroughly test your tank on a lot of technical minutiae, and I feel that this will result in a lot of full wipes on trash packs that a more experienced tank would handle with little issue.  There are a lot of things in here that can easily catch people off-guard, but most of the bosses are pretty easy, even **Azerokk**. However, I do see **Mogul Razdunk** potentially farming some groups at the end of a close run. I do think the timer nerfs probably were a bit overkill in this regard, and that this is the first key where you might feel as if a couple of extra minutes would be welcome.

**Cinderbrew Meadery - 6**

This has some of the harder trash of the season, and a **lot of it**.  Almost every pack has some dangerous combos that can kill a player if they don't manage their defensives properly, and the timer in this dungeon can feel quite tight without pulling massive, and even then it is still a little close.  The bosses in here are also all quite easy to wipe too, and particularly **Benk** and **Goldie** will probably be outliers on the heat map for deaths in this dungeon.

**Operation: Floodgate - 7**

This is put here mostly due to it being a new dungeon, and all the difficulties that come with that.  Besides that, the trash *can* be nasty at times, with the final trash on the way to the last boss being the outlier and quite difficult, especially the mini-boss **Bubbles**.  As well as this, all the bosses in this dungeon can be challenging and have several mechanics that can wipe the entire group if failed.  Lastly, the final boss **Geezle Gigazap**, is the current hardest boss of all dungeons, being a significant healing and mechanic check.  **Swampface** also has the potential of being quite difficult for players first seeing it.

**Priory of the Sacred Flame - 8**

The indisputable king for the entirety of the PTR cycle, **Priory** is definitely the key to avoid as of current tuning.  Like **Dawnbreaker** in Season 1, this could end up being exactly the opposite, and somehow end up the free-est key of the pool, but right now, if I had to bet money, I'd say this is a certified **BRICK** (tm) for 95% of players on a 10 or higher the first week.

I'm hopeful that these dungeons will not launch with the health they had on PTR and Blizzard tunes them accordingly as we were quite high ilvl, but we shall see.
