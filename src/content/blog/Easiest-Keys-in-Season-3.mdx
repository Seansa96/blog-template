title: Easiest Keys in Season 3
---

If you're wondering what dungeons to avoid, and what dungeons are a free weekly key, look no further.

**Spoiler: They're all pretty easy**

This list will be ordered 1 to 8, from easiest to hardest.

# Eco-Dome Aldani

Despite being a completely new dungeon, which usually means there's an associated learning curve that artificially hikes the relative difficulty for a few weeks, this key is the easiest in the pool, its only competition being **Gambit**.

The trash in this dungeon is by far the easiest, and the bosses overall are quite simple.  The timer is quite lenient, there are no real massive spikes in difficulty throughout, and players should be delighted to see the name of this key appear in their bags throughout Season 3.

# So'leah's Gambit

A fan favorite key for a reason, this dungeon has seen several large changes that have massively reduced its already easy difficulty to an almost "free" level of challenge.

The only reason this key isn't the easiest of the pool is due to the second boss, **Timecap'n Hooktail**, which is a simple encounter that is deceptively easy to make mistakes that quickly derail the fight.

# Streets of Wonder

This dungeon used to be significantly harder than its other half, **Gambit**, but after several hard-hitting nerfs this dungeon is no longer as fearsome as it once was.

It is now quite a relatively lax key, the only difficulty being its rather tight timer due to eating a 7 minute reduction at the start of the PTR cycle.

Still, by simply pulling big and fast you can easily time this key, and the reworked RP event outside of the **Oasis** has made this a significantly more enjoyable experience.

# Ara-Kara

Now we get to the dungeons that are a little closer in difficulty.  I would say this dungeon is a *step up* compared to the previous 3, but not massively so.  

The changes to the first area (the **Engorged Crawlers**, **Flyers**, mini-bosses, and **Attendants**) have all resulted in a net nerf, flattening the difficulty of the area, but on higher keys it starts to result in some rather annoying damage patterns that are best resolved by simply bringing many dispels or a **Shaman** for **Poison Cleansing Totem**.

The **Bloodguards** have seen a rather large change in that they now cast **Locust Swarm**, no longer doing a single burst of damage every so often, but now doing a high amount of damage over a fairly long period of time, making any other trash quite deadly during this period and increasing the overall healing required in the key by a large amount.

Besides that, the last boss has seen pretty massive nerfs that should make it much less of a crapshoot with PUGs, and its for that reason I can't reasonably place it any higher, despite how much less fun it is to play through now.

# Dawnbreaker

While I initially wanted to place this higher due to how many times I've seen this key bricked in the first area on testing, it really is not that difficult of a key overall.

Many mobs had their damage nerfed, in particular the mini-bosses who have seen a staggering 22% nerf to their main damage source, **Abyssal Rot**, and several key abilities were removed from the trash in the second area, or otherwise reworked.  This has resulted in the only difficult part of the dungeon being the first 2 pulls, which are still quite troublesome for PUGs, and as long as you get through them in-tact, you can expect a relatively easy experience afterwards.

# Floodgate

This dungeon has seen pretty much no changes despite the admittedly massive **removal of Bubbles**, owing to its pretty healthy design and state coming out of last season.  This dungeon should play fairly identically besides having a few annoying pulls removed, but still scales to be quite a beast around the 18-20+ mark, which is why its placed on the upper part of this list.

# Priory of the Sacred Flame

While still overall a difficult dungeon, a few targeted nerfs and alterations to some of the more problematic trash have resulted in an overall far healthier experience in this dungeon.

The right side has been made to be significantly more equivalent to the left, and will now be the preferred route of choice for most PUGs in season 3.

You'll now see a slightly reworked first boss, but the rest of the dungeon outside of this first area is now much easier, and the waygate change also makes wiping on the second boss trash much less punishing as well.

# Halls of Atonement

While you might be surprised to see this as the hardest key of Season 3, due to this being a relatively easy key back in **Shadowlands**, this dungeon has not aged particularly well with the modern game and had a lot of issues that needed addressing throughout the PTR cycle.

While feedback has curtailed many of them, this is the tightest dungeon by far and has the hardest trash in the pool, while also having many of the hardest bosses.

For the weekly key, it shouldn't be that much of a step-up now that testers' have reduced its difficulty to something more in-line with everything else, but you should expect to see this be quite challenging the higher you go.
