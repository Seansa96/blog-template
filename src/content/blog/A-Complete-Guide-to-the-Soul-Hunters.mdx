title: A Complete Guide to the Soul Hunters
---


This is a council style encounter against three powerful Demon Hunters, one of each specialization. It is a hectic and frenetic battle to defeat all three opponents simultaneously before they all realize that if they use their Metamorphosis at the same time, there is 0 counterplay and they will murder your raid in short order.

They do not share health, and must all be defeated within a short time span or else they will overwhelm the raid with unavoidable damage.
# Abilities

**Adarus Duskblaze (Void Demon Hunter)** 

Adarus does not melee and does not move traditionally, opting to instead chain cast **Consume** in between his other abilities.

* **Devourer's Ire** - **Adarus** spawns several orbs that crash down onto the ground, dealing light damage per orb to the raid if not intercepted.  Players can soak these to become afflicted by **Devourer's Ire**, a magic debuff that can be dispelled. **Adarus** continually casts **Consume** at these players, dealing light damage but applying a light healing absorb each time that stacks. **On Heroic and higher**, each cast of **Consume** also increases damage taken by **Consume** by 20% per stack, lasting for a minute. Dispelling **Devourer's Ire** deals light raid damage, and transfers it to a nearby player. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/soulhunters/devourerire.webp" />
* **Voidstep** - **Adarus** teleports to a targeted location, dealing moderate damage to anyone in the path and spawning several images of himself that cast **Hungering Slash**. This deals moderate damage to anyone within 8 yards, and also spawns a pool of **Encroaching Oblivion**. Players with **Devourer's Ire** can consume these pools to clear the encounter space. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/soulhunters/voidstep.webp" />

**Velaryn Bloodwrath** (**Havoc Demon Hunter**)

**Velaryn** melees and has a regular aggro table, and must be tanked.

* **The Hunt** - **Velaryn** picks a player and begins casting **The Hunt**. At the end of the cast, she dashes towards them, dealing lethal damage to them.  This damage can be reduced by players standing in the line of the dash.  **On Heroic and higher**, players within this line also cleave anyone in a small radius around them. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/soulhunters/thehunt.webp" />
* **Blade Dance** - **Velaryn** slashes nearby locations, dealing moderate damage to anyone struck. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/soulhunters/bladedance.webp" />
* **Eye Beam** - **Velaryn** channels a beam of chaos energy at her current target, hitting anyone within the effect but also tracking her target.  This applies **Fel Singed**, increasing their damage taken by **Eye Beam** by 10% a stack. Each cast of **Eye Beam** will afflict 4 stacks to her target. Upon finishing the **Eye Beam** cast, she will cast **Felblade** at her target, dealing light damage to them and afflicting them with a light DoT. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/soulhunters/eyebeam.webp" />
* **Fel Inferno** - Light rot that persists throughout the encounter. This also is the name of the damage event associated with attempting to leave the arena, which deals high damage every second to any player who does so.

**Ilyssa Darksorrow** (**Vengeance Demon Hunter**)

**Ilyssa** melees her current target and has a regular aggro table, and must be tanked.

* **Fracture** - **Ilyssa** shatters the soul of her current target, dealing large damage to them and applying **Shattered Soul**, increasing damage taken from **Fracture** by 125% for 40 seconds.  This also applies **Frailty**, reducing healing received by 33% a stack. Players can recover the afflicted tank's soul by walking over it, removing a stack of **Frailty** from the tank and afflicting the soaking player with a light DoT that lasts 30 seconds, stacking. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/soulhunters/fracturefrag.webp" />
* **Spirit Bomb** - Light raid damage that also applies **Soulcrush**, a moderate healing absorb. If any of the tank's soul fragments are uncollected, she does an additional burst of damage to the raid per uncollected fragment.
* **Immolation Aura** - Light rot cast periodically by **Ilyssa**.

**Intermissions**

Upon reaching full energy, each member of the council will use **Metamorphosis**, with the other two members taking the time to rest and watch the fight play out. The observing Demon Hunters take 99% reduced damage during this time, while the remaining Demon Hunter takes regular damage and casts their ultimate ability.

These intermissions occur in a static order, listed below.

**Adarus Duskblaze** - **Collapsing Star**

* **Adarus** floats in the center of the arena, spawning an **Event Horizon** beneath him and pulling all players towards him. A large amount of **Stellar Fragments** spawn around the arena, attempting to reach **Adarus**. If they do so, **Adarus** pulses for moderate raid damage per **Fragment**. Players can intercept these, taking light damage. **On Heroic and higher**, soaking a **Fragment** also applies a light stacking DoT. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/soulhunters/collapsingstar.webp" />

**Velaryn Bloodwrath - Fel Rush**

* **Velaryn** stands in the center of the room, afflicting several players at a time with **Fel Rush**, which deals a moderate amount of damage to any player caught within the indicated visual.  This is quite reminiscent of **Nexus Princess**. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/soulhunters/felrush.webp" />

**Ilyssa Darksorrow - Fel Devastation**

* **Ilyssa** leaps around the room with **Infernal Strike**, dealing moderate damage to any player caught within the indicated visual before channeling **Fel Devastation**, dealing large ticking damage to anyone caught in the cone. She repeats this several times before the phase ends. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/soulhunters/feldevastation.webp" />

**Enrage - All 3 Intermissions**

* Upon reaching the fourth intermission, all 3 members of the council cast their abilities simultaneously, quickly eliminating the raid.

# Strategy (Normal and Heroic)

**You should lust on pull**

* The fight is fairly simple to execute, despite how many abilities there are.
* Tanks should do their best to keep the bosses together for cleave as much as possible, as two of the bosses leap about the room quite often. The raid should maintain an even spread of damage across all targets.
* The target of **The Hunt** should make sure to stretch their line as long as possible, so that as many players as possible can help soak. Anyone that is healthy enough to help soak should help, as this is the single biggest cause of deaths. **On Heroic and higher**, make sure to spread out within the line so that you don't take extra damage.
* Whoever has **Devourer's Ire** should focus on soaking as many pools as they can, ideally at least 5-7 before being dispelled.
* Tanks should swap on **Fracture** and after **Felblade**.  The tank who was **Fractured** should try to wait until their souls have been retrieved before picking up the other boss unless they are confident they will survive. Try to point **Eye Beam** in a consistent location so players do not accidentally get cleaved by it.

**First Intermission**

* The raid should simply spread out around the room and make sure to soak all of the **Fragments** traveling towards the boss.  If you are not a tanky class, avoid going over 4 stacks. 
* Take care as melee not to take a tick of damage from the **Event Horizon** under the boss, as it can very quickly finish you off if you are not topped.

**Second Intermission**

* The raid should again spread out around the boss as much as possible, with ranged standing far.  Players should move up and down their line to avoid other players, or simply stand still and let others move. For tankier classes, this is generally the preferred move if you are in melee as it can get quite crowded.

**Third Intermission**

* Overall, this is the simplest one to play. Movement CDs should be used on each leap to make it to the safe side of the boss.

**Final Intermission**

* You can live a decent amount into this intermission if you are quick enough. The priority is getting out of the **Fel Devastation** breath, and you realistically have until a bunch of the balls start reaching **Adarus** until you die.  Immunities and high damage reductions can be utilized here to extend the phase for DoTs to kill the boss if necessary.

# Mythic Changes

The mythic changes focus on tighter coordination and spatial awareness, as well as complicating the soaking of most mechanics somewhat.

* **Adarus** now casts **Eradicate**, which deals near lethal damage to any player struck.
* **Velaryn** now casts **The Hunt** three times in a row, staggered.  Soaking **The Hunt** now also applies a debuff that increases damage taken by the ability by 500% for 10 seconds, requiring 3 groups of players now to soak all lines.
* **Eye Beam** now also increases the damage taken from **Felblade** as well.
* **Ilyssa** now uses **Sigil of Chains** pulling the entire raid to her location after a 2.5 second cast.
* In each intermission, all players are chained in groups to the nearest 3 players shortly before it begins.  

# Mythic Strategy

* The fight plays pretty much the same. The major changes are obviously to **The Hunt** and to the intermissions.
* Each player should again strive to extend their line as far as they can when targeted by **The Hunt**. This mechanic is how you will bleed players the easiest, and so this should be the greatest priority while it is happening.
* The tank holding **Ilyssa** now needs to taunt just before **Felblade** is cast, as this does a massive burst of damage to their tank now. The tank holding **Velaryn** can also just pop a large CD here or call for an external and eat it.
* In the intermissions, players should spread around the room and stack with their assigned groups. The center player of the chain is the one who will dictate the movement of the group, and they should be the one to decide how and in what direction their group should move.
* In the first intermission, players can very easily choose a "lane" to soak orbs in and very little movement is required.
* In the second intermission, players should spread as far as they can from each other in the chain, and plant. Players should quite literally never move and simply pop damage reductions as needed if they are going to be hit by multiple lines.
* In the third intermission, players should simply follow the middle player of the chain to the safe spots. The easiest way to handle movement is to simply move about the outside of the room after the first leap, using movement speed cooldowns accordingly.
