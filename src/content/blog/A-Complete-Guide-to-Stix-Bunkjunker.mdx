This encounter is almost the prototypical Hectic Add Cleave fight, and is largely about controlling both the room and the adds. The boss does not particularly matter, and while boss damage is still needed to kill the boss, keeping ahead on the various enemies in this encounter is far more important.  

The main theme of this boss deals with a Katamari-style garbage ball mechanic, where you roll over small piles of trash or adds and then roll over bigger piles of trash or bigger adds before finally either rolling into the boss or soaking up a raid wiping bomb.

# Important Abilities

(Somehow didn't record any of my testing on this one. Clips provided by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@magicWL">MagicWL</a> on YouTube)

* **Rolling Rubbish** - Stix will select up to four players, with 1 always being the current tank, to become balls of garbage (yes, your raid members are now objectively trash).  You will have a meter that fills up with each pile of garbage or add you run over.  You may *only* run over small piles of garbage/hyenas at first, and once you have filled up your meter halfway you may then begin collecting larger piles of garbage/scrapmasters.  Running into the boss with a Rolling Rubbish ball will also deal up to 1.5% of its health, based on the ball's size.

* **Discarded Doomsplosive** - Large bombs spawned with each wave of garbage. These have a timer over them indicated how long until they blow, and when they do finally explode they wipe the raid in spectacular fashion.  The only way to prevent their explosion is to run over them with a fully charged garbage ball.
* <img src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-stix/doomsplosive.webp"/>
* **Electromagnetic Sorting** - Upon reaching 100 energy, Stix will do raid damage over 5 seconds, also spawning in various trash and adds
* <img src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-stix/electromagneticsorting.webp"/>
* **Overdrive** - Stix reduces all damage taken by 99%, flying overhead and raining down a barrage of swirlies. He will then land, dealing lethal damage to anything in a large radius and empowering himself, summoning 1 additional Doomsplosive and increasing his attack speed by 25% for the rest of the encounter.
* <img src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-stix/overdrive.webp"/>
* **Incinerator** - Stix will mark several players with fire, afflicting them with a light DoT. If these players touch anyone else, it will spread the debuff to them. If these players touch piles of garbage, they will ignite it, making it unable to be picked up by Rolling Rubbish as well as emitting Toxic Fumes for the rest of the encounter, increasing overall raid damage taken.
* <img src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-stix/incinerator.webp"/>
* **Scrapmasters** - These adds are summoned during each Electromagnetic Sorting, and hop around with Dumpster Dive, leaping to a random player and dealing high damage to anything they hit. They will also cast Scrap Rockets, an interruptible channel that deals very high damage.
* <img src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-stix/dumpsterdive.webp"/>
* <img src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-stix/scraprocket.webp"/>
* **Territorial Bombshell** - With each wave of trash, 3 bombshells will spawn on various piles.  These are immune to CC until brought below 75% HP.  You have 30 seconds to kill each one, before they detonate, exploding and applying Short Fuse to the raid, a high damage DoT.  Running over these with Rolling Rubbish will destroy them instantly, but also trigger Short Fuse.

# Strategy (Normal and Heroic)

* The fight revolves around keeping the adds under control while making sure to also prevent every single Doomsplosive from detonating.  As the Rolling Rubbish mechanic is entirely random besides picking 1 tank every time, you cannot strictly assign players to pick up the Doomsplosive, so everyone must have an idea of how the mechanic works and what to do.
* Players who have already filled up their meter beyond the halfway point should *only* pick up Scrapmasters/medium sized piles of trash.  You want each garbage ball to be able to hit full, and larger balls wasting piles they no longer solely benefit from is detrimental to this goal.
* The raid group should be loosely spread around where the boss is, following it as the fight evolves.  Care should be taken not to light piles of trash as well, and pre-spreading/movement should be done ahead of Incinerator casts.  
* It is quite difficult for tanks to pick up aggro on all the adds during this encounter as they are incredibly spread upon spawn. If one picks up aggro, they should do their best to get close to the AoE stack under the boss, but still prioritize being spread if an Incinerator cast is coming soon.
* Trash piles that are aflame cannot be picked up, but also cannot be really set further aflame, so these are somewhat of a safe zone for players with Incinerator, in the worst case.
* Tanks should focus their garbage balls on adds primarily, as being picked up by the Rolling Rubbish makes the adds take 100% increased damage. Early on in the fight, the tank ball should be used to group up all the adds and crash into the boss, making them easily killed.
* On Heroic, special care should be taken to avoid running into the Bombshells with the Rolling Rubbish, as this can prove disastrous, and even in the best case will put healers behind on healing.
* The later waves of Doomsplosives will require every single ball to fill its meter and collect a bomb, so it is vital that the above rules are followed.
* On Normal, it is not as important, but on Heroic players should make sure to kick every single cast of the Scrap Rockets, as this can easily kill someone in between everything else happening.
* **For Tanks**, this is another tank combo.  He will cast Meltdown->Overdrive->Meltdown, so you will want to taunt **after** the Overdrive to ensure that you only take the Meltdown, if you are the tank not currently tanking.  The tank who was tanking first (and thus took Meltdown into Overdrive), will need to pop something as they will be actively taking damage as the Overdrive hits.

# Mythic Changes

The Mythic changes to the encounter do not largely change how it is approached, but make it much more unforgiving and drastically increases the importance of proper trash control.

* Prototype Powercoils now spawn, which are large towers that focus on a random player and electrocute them, giving them a stacking debuff that increases their damage taken by this tower.
* Scrapmasters now have an additional ability called **The Recycler**, which is a 10 second cast that deals lethal damage to its target.
* With each Overdrive, Stix will summon an additional Scrapmaster with each wave of garbage.

# Mythic Strategy

* Again, the strategy isn't really changed much from Heroic.  You will still focus on picking up garbage piles, still run over Doomsplosives, still position largely the same.
* The Powercoils don't require any particularly wild gameplay or focus. If you are taking high stacks from one, simply move away from it and it will begin damaging someone else.  Healers just need to pay special attention to these players if they have stacks going into an Electromagnetic Sorting, or if they have Incinerator and this mechanic.
* The Scrapmasters are now the crux of this encounter, arguably.  As they are immune to CC, the only way to stop the Recycler is for a player with a medium-sized garbage ball to run over them. This means that this becomes the 2nd most important thing in the encounter to handle or you will simply slowly bleed players over time.  

# Notes on Healing

The healing requirement of this fight isn't particularly high, as most of it is random bits of chip damage from adds, Incinerator DoTs, and the slowly accumulating Toxic Fumes. The Electromagnetic Sorting is a predictable amount of damage and not particularly intense given that. 

In pugs and in early prog you will likely find that many players outrange you frequently, which I don't have a particularly great solution to, but just be aware of this and do your best.

# Notes on Tanking

As I mentioned in the <a href="#strategy-normal-and-heroic">Strategy</a> section, there is a tank combo you must pay close attention to in order not to get one-tapped by the boss, ala Rashok or Sikran.  It's not too complicated, thankfully, it is basically just taunt after Overdrive if you're not currently tanking, and you should make certain to pop something *for* the Overdrive if you are tanking.

Besides that, it's a gigantic pain in the tuchus to gather all the adds on this fight, and if you're not currently tanking you should do your best to collect them all.  When you get selected to be the ball, you should focus primarily on picking up adds with yours and then rolling into the boss unless you are needed for stopping the Doomsplosives.  

On Heroic, make sure you move the boss over to Territorial Bomshells while they're stationary for more efficient damage overall. Otherwise, try to keep melee decently far away from trash piles so that they don't inadvertently light them on fire.

# Defensive Usage

Defensives are best used during Electromagnetic Sorting or if you get the Incinerator debuff and aren't topped.  If you don't have a kick and you're selected by a Scrapmaster for their cast, you may also want to defensive that so you're not murdered in short order.  As long as you stay in range of healers, however, you should be mostly fine.

# Movement Cooldowns

Movement is best used when shifting positions around the arena.  You generally do not want to have the boss tanked near any large clumps of trash piles, and on Heroic and higher you want to move the boss to Bombshells to cleave them down.  Thus, movement such as Roars or Windrush are quite helpful in those scenarios.  

You may also choose to use movement during Overdrive to aid in dodging swirlies to minimize needless deaths to that mechanic.

# Damage Profile Best Suited for this Encounter

Generally speaking, boss damage is not particularly important for this fight at the moment.  The greatest threat is being overwhelmed by the various adds of the encounter, so bringing in cleave and classes that can aid in grouping the adds for cleave are best.  Boomkins are in general quite good here, but are a little scary to play as they quite easily grab aggro on just about everything.  Priority cleave is also quite good, such as that what a Devastation Evoker or Spriest can provide.  Destro is also quite good for eliminating the more crucial adds.  Frost is good for quickly attacking priority targets as well, but Fire and Ele can do very good boss damage while destroying everything around it.

A mix of these is best, with a few specs like Fire and Ele covering all the boss damage you'll realistically need.
