---

The fight against Gallywix is a multi-stage, highly technical encounter that will stress your raid's ability to coordinate and move as a unit throughout. It revolves around sabotaging the Giga Coils around the encounter space by using the Giga bombs dropped by adds you can defeat during the fight and dealing with the various Cannisters used. By using Gallywix's inventions against him, you can turn the tide and defeat him, putting an end to the Chrome King's reign and stopping him from unleashing his twisted weaponry against his own people.

# Important Abilities

As you can tell, there's a lot of abilities in this fight. We'll break it down by each phase.

**Phase One**

* **Scatterblast Cannisters** - **Gallywix** fires a blast at his current tank, inflicting a massive amount of damage to them. This portion cannot be dodged or parried. **Additionally**, this also blasts players in a frontal cone centered on the tank (presumably moving with them), dealing a massive amount of damage but split between all players struck. **This also increases their damage taken from this ability by 100% for 30 seconds**.  All targets hit become afflicted with **Mechengineer's Cannisters**. If this fails to hit at least 3 players, this will instead hit all players for the full, unsplit damage, resulting in a wipe. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/scatterblastcannister.webp"/>
* **Mechengineer's Cannisters** - A healing absorb placed on those who soaked the **Scatterblast Cannister**, which lasts for 30 seconds. Upon expiration or being fully consumed, this will deal damage to the player based on how much was left in the absorb. **On Heroic**, this deals damage to the entire raid based on how much was left.  Presumably, if it's consumed, it will deal no damage. If it is not healed whatsoever, it does the full amount of the absorb to all players for each person not healed.
* **Big Bad Buncha Bombs** - This is one ability, but has several components to it.  The first is the main ordnance, which is a rain of artillery that deals lethal damage to any players caught in the indicated visuals. Any players hit by any of these components receive **Blast Burns**, a stacking, light damage but long-lasting (45 seconds) DoT. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/bigbadbunchabombs.webp"/>
* **Bad Belated Boom** - The next component of **Big Bad Buncha Bombs**. Several of the bombs had out-of-compliance safety fuses, causing them to detonate late.  These inflict moderate damage to players within the indicated 7-yard radius, and applies **Blast Burns**. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/badbelatedboom.webp"/>
* **Sapper's Satchels** - The third component of **Big Bad Buncha Bombs**. Several players will be marked, exploding after 5 seconds for light damage.  Any players within 7 yards when these detonate receive that damage, **Blast Burns** AND **Sapper's Satchels**. **On Heroic**, when the marked players detonate, they also drop a pile of bombs at their feet, which explode moments later dealing moderate damage. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/sappersatchel.webp"/>
* **1500-Pound DUD** - **On Heroic**, two large munitions will embed themselves into the arena, exploding after 15 seconds for high damage to the entire raid and applying a high damage DoT that stacks. A player can instead interact with this ordnance to focus the blast, similar to **Z'skarn**, instead taking 10 Million damage and knocking them back. The player who triggers this will also receive **Focused Detonation**, a high damage DoT that lasts 10 seconds.  Lastly, shortly after **Focused Detonation** expires, a **Time-Release Crackle** blasts throughout the arena, dealing light damage to the raid. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/1500pounddud.webp"/>
* **Zagging Zizzlers** - Miniature rockets fly about the various piles, dealing light damage to the raid for 30 seconds. This stacks.
* **Suppression** - **Gallywix** shrapnels players in indicated locations for 3 seconds, inflicting light damage on impact and then afflicting players hit with a light DoT that stacks every 0.5 seconds. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/suppression.webp"/>
* **Venting Heat** - **Gallywix's** machines dump excess heat, burning all players in the arena, dealing a light burst of damage up-front then very light damage over 4 seconds. Every time he casts this, the next cast is 1 second longer due to the inefficiency of his invention's heat dissipation.
* **Gatling Cannon** - Instead of melee'ing, **Gallywix** shoots his main target, dealing up to 200% increased damage based on how far they are from him.
* **Trick Shots** - **Gallywix** gains this buff every 4 seconds, stacking. If he reaches 10 stacks of this **OR** if his main target changes, he will release all stacks, dealing 2.5 Million physical damage plus a ~400k a second DoT per stack that lasts 9 seconds.  This cannot be dodged.

**Phase Two**

**Gallywix** retains much of the abilities from **Phase One**, like **Big Bad Buncha Bombs and all related components, Suppression, and Venting Heat**, but **Scatterblast Cannisters** has been modified, and he now summons additional adds and makes use of the **Giga Coils** that surround the arena.

* **Giga Coils** - **Gallywix** charges and activates the **Giga Coils** around the room, causing moderate ticking damage every second.  **On Heroic**, this also causes **Overloaded Bolts**, creating swirlies to dodge that cause light damage in indicated locations. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/gigacoils.webp"/>
* **Giga Blast** - **Gallywix** collects the power of the **Giga Coils** and ejects it in a direction, several times, dealing moderate damage to anyone struck and also afflicting them with a light, stacking DoT.  Each successive blast increases **Giga Coil** damage by 15%. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/gigablast.webp"/>
* **Giga BOOM!** - **Giga Bombs** detonate after 30 seconds, inflicting moderate damage to the raid plus a light DoT that ticks every second for 9 seconds. This stacks per explosion.
* **Sabotaged Controls** - When a **Giga Controls** on a **Giga Coil** are damaged, they spark occasionally, dealing light damage to targeted players every 6 seconds per each **Sabotaged Control**.
* **Control Meltdown** - Sabotaging a **Giga Controls** causes this for 1 minute. If **Gallywix** attempts to cast **Giga Coils** during this time, it backfires, interrupting the cast.
* **Sabotage Zone** - When both **Giga Controls** on a **Giga Coil** are damaged, this covers their quadrant of the room, dealing moderate damage every second to players in the area. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/sabotagezone.webp"/>
* **Fused Cannisters** - **Gallywix** marks several players and launches shells at them that detonate after 6 seconds. Upon detonation, this deals light damage, split evenly among everyone in an 8 yard radius.  All targets who soak this receive **Mechengineer's Cannisters**, the same effect from **Phase One** and working similarly, exploding for damage to the player equal to the healing absorb remaining. **On Heroic**, this deals damage to the whole raid instead, just as in **Phase One**.  Any marked player who fails to share this effect with at least 1 other player causes this to instead affect the entire raid for the full effect. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/fusedcannisters.webp"/>
* **Darkfuse Technician** - These arrive in on a **Party Crashing Rocket**, dealing light damage to any players within the indicated visual on impact.  These do not do much, except **Juice It!**, which charges a **Giga Bomb**, causing it to explode for light damage in a 10 yard radius and increase their damage and movement speed by 5%, stacking. These drop **Charged Giga Bombs** on death. 
* **Giga Bomb** - These are dropped by **Darkfuse Technicians** on death, and radiate very light damage in a 3 yard radius. They can be picked up by players, instead focusing that damage to them. A player carrying this **Bomb** can choose to **Fling Giga Bomb**, throwing it to a targeted location.  Carrying this near a **Giga Controls** causes **Giga Bomb Detonation**, inflicting a jolt to the player carrying the **Bomb** and sabotaging the **Controls**. This jolt also gives the player 30% movement speed for 10 seconds.
* **Sharpshot Sentry** - These cast **Shock Barrage** at a random player, an interruptible channel that deals high damage over 4 seconds.
* **Darkfuse Wrenchmonger** - These arrive in on a **Party Crashing Rocket**, dealing light damage to any players within the indicated visual on impact. These can be tanked and deal high damage with **Wrench**, which debuffs their main target with every cast, increasing their damage taken from **Wrench** by 40% a stack.  They also enrage with **Lumbering Rage**, gaining 50% damage but 50% reduced movement speed. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/darkfusewrenchmongers.webp"/>
**Intermission**
* **Cratering** - **Gallywix** slams down into the arena, dealing massive (and certainly lethal) damage to any players within 20 yards of the impact, and moderate damage to the entire raid. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/cratering.webp"/>
* **Armageddon-Class Plating** - A shield from the **Darkfuse** that prevents **Gallywix** from being interrupted. 
* **Radiant Electricity** - **On Heroic**, **Gallywix** rotates a beam of lightning that stuns and deals moderate damage to any player caught.  This can be outranged and is irrelevant for ranged DPS/ranged healers. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/radiantbeam.webp"/>
* **Total Destruction** - **Gallywix** rains down rockets on the entire raid, causing light damage that increases by 20% with every tick, lasting 30 seconds. 

**Phase Three**

**Gallywix** retains a mix of abilities from **Phase Two**, with some modifications to make them more deadly. He no longer summons **Sharpshot Sentries** or **Darkfuse Wrenchmongers**, however. **Fused Cannisters** have become **Tick-Tock Cannisters**. Several abilities from **Big Bad Buncha Bombs** have also seen modification, and **Suppression** has a new effect.

* **Big Badder Bomb Blast** - **Gallywix** shells his primary target with this, inflicting moderate damage to them anyone with 30 yards. This also causes anyone hit to take 200% increased damage for 1.5 minutes. Anyone hit also receives **Blast Burns**. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/biggerbadderbombblast.webp"/>
* **Overloaded Rockets** - **Sapper's Satchel** is removed in exchange for this ability.  This attaches rockets to several players, causing them to shoot out a barrage of rockets in indicated directions, inflicting a massive DoT to anyone hit as well as knocking them back. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/overloadedrockets.webp"/>
* **Tick-Tock Cannisters** - **Gallywix** ejects volatile cannisters around the arena which embed themselves into the floor.  These detonate after 5 seconds, dealing light damage, split amongst all players soaking each one. All targets hit are afflicted with **Mechengineer's Cannisters**, once again causing the same effect from **Phase One and Two**. If any of these fail to hit at least a single player, it instead affects the entire raid with their effect per unsoaked **Cannister**. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/ticktockcannisters.webp"/>
* **Gallywix Finale Burst** - **Gallywix** finishes **Suppression** with pizzazz, firing a larger shock around himself that deals lethal damage to all players, but is reduced by distance from the epicenter. <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/LoU/converted-gallywix/gallywixfinale.webp"/>
* **Ego Check** - **On Heroic** this replaces **Trick Shots**, causing **Gallywix** instead to deal a 4-hit combo that deals moderate damage with each strike. This cannot be dodged or parried, and 90% of the unmitigated damage is dealt as a DoT called **Checked Ego** that lasts 22 seconds, and it can stack.

# Strategy (Normal and Heroic)

The boss remains stationary for **Phase One**, and in **Phase Two**, he jumps to different points of the room after a **Big Bad Buncha Bombs**. In the **Intermission**, he'll mount his mechsuit and in **Phase Three** will be normally tankable like most other mobs.  

Much of the difficulty stems from the length of the encounter and the raid damage. Mechanically, it is actually quite simple and easy to execute.

**Phase One**
* The simplest phase, as there are no **Giga Coils** to deal with.  You will want two teams to rotate through soaking the **Scatterblast Cannisters**.  **Odds** first, **Evens** second is a tale as old as time, and will be the simplest way to deal with this.
* You will need a large healing cooldown to heal off the healing absorb for each one of these **Cannister** soaks. The boss is stationary, so the groups should organize themselves opposite of each other. Mark the tank of each group and have everyone follow their movements.
* As this soak will sometimes overlap with other abilities, make sure players know not to dodge *out* of the soak, but within it.
* During the **Big Bad Buncha Bombs**, you will want the raid to spread a fair bit away from each other to give room for dodging. For **Sapper's Satchels**, players should dodge backwards if possible, while everyone else dodges forwards.
* **On Heroic**, tanks and players with immunities should soak the **1500 Pound DUD** as soon as they can. The tank not tanking should attempt to get both, as this will make it so the raid only takes one **Time-Released Crackle**, instead of two. But, you should prioritize getting them off of the map over this, as one going off is a wipe.
* **Tanks** should swap on each **Scatterblast Cannister**.
* The scariest part of this phase is the 3rd **Scatterblast** and the final **Scatterblast**. These are good times to personal. You should also health pot any time you feel threatened as it will be back up for the later parts of **Phase Three**.
* 
**Phase Two**

* From this point on, the fight becomes about managing the **Giga Coils** and preventing them from dealing their massive damage to the raid.  However, you must make certain that you balance this while keeping the play space open for play. 
* I will make this very simple. Mark each coil with a different world marker. In this example, we will use **Diamond**, **Star**, **Circle**, and **Orange**. Each coil should be broken once, going around the circle, and then broken again as needed. On **Normal** and **Heroic**, you will realistically never see a **Sabotage Zone** doing this unless your DPS is extremely low.
* To clarify, this would mean the first **Giga Coil** to be sabotaged would be **Diamond**, then **Star**, then **Circle**, then **Orange**. And then after this, you would simply go in that order again. As a **Coil** must be broken twice to be removed from the fight, this means your enrage timer is **eight total Giga Coil** casts.
* You should have players assigned to pick up **Giga Bombs**, although anyone who understands the mechanic can feel free to do it. Players carrying **Giga Bombs** should be careful not to be struck by the **Giga Blast**, as this will not only damage them, but destroy the bomb, possibly preventing the raid from stopping the **Giga Coil** cast, likely causing a wipe.
* The tank not currently tanking should pick up the **Darkfuse Wrenchmonger** and any other adds and bring them to the boss for cleave. The tank who has **Gallywix** can assist in this as well as needed.  The **Wrench** stacks should not be a great concern on these difficulties, and worst case you may simply need to pop something. These should be cleaved down.
* Players should make certain to interrupt the **Sharpshot Sentries**, as their **Shock Barrage** cast can combo a player taking damage from other mechanics.
* You should bring all **Fused Cannisters** into melee and make a venn diagram with them. There are sometimes **Sapper's Satchels** during this, and these should be dropped off to the left or right of the raid.
* 
**Intermission**

* **Gallywix** will go up in the air and slam down where he is. Melee should move out and then back in when it's over.
* This is where you will lust on **Heroic**, or **Normal** if you are struggling with **Phase Three**.
* Players should make certain to stay as grouped as possible for healing while breaking the shield, and on **Heroic** should also care for the **Radiant Electricity** beam.
* You do not need to interrupt immediately, and should milk this phase for as long as possible if you are able to.

**Phase Three**

* This plays much the same as **Phase Two**, with some slight changes.
* Players with the **Overloaded Rockets** should still follow the same pattern of dodging out of the raid towards the outside, and they should in general try to go to certain areas to make it so the **Rockets** all come from the same general area. Pre-spreading in particular is quite effective, and you should move so that your rockets are not aimed directly at the boss.
* On **Normal**, everyone should simply move out of melee then back in for the **Suppression**. On **Heroic**, this deals far more damage, and all players should move out to around 30+ yards as this damage can outright kill you as it typically happens just after a **Tick-Tock Cannisters**.
* Movement should be saved for the **Tick-Tock Cannisters**, so that players can get to a soak in time and then move out for the **Suppression**. Players should simply get to a **Cannister** and plant. 
* The tank who receives the **Bigger Badder Bomb Blast** should move to a far off location to explode. Tanks will swap on each one of these. **Ego Check** must simply be endured and you will take two in between the **Bigger Badder Bomb Blasts**.
* Towards the end of the encounter, you will have much less space for dealing with all of the above, and there should be a much greater focus on player's baiting properly.  Tanks may also take the **Bigger Badder Bomb Blast** into the **Sabotage Zones** as space dictates.

# Mythic Changes

The amount of changes this encounter sees on Mythic is almost unprecedented. For now, suffice to say this will have its own post.

# Notes on Healing

Like **Mug'Zee**, there is far more healing required in this fight than all the others. There is constant rot throughout, with moments of high burst damage to the raid, spot healing, and triage. Almost all healing profiles will be seen throughout this encounter.

The raid will alternate being stacked and spread, and understanding these moments will be at the core of you properly healing this encounter.  There will also be moments of high movement at which you will also need to do a large amount of healing.  For each **Big Bad Buncha Bombs**, you should factor in this movement and be ready for it and have a plan for how best to do your healing during it.

The **Cannister** mechanic makes up the bulk of healing on this fight and having a plan for each one is critical to your raid's success. On **Heroic**, the **Suppression** is also a massive amount of damage and must be planned for.

**Giga Coils** begins as a large amount of damage and then quickly becomes tame. Be careful of stray casts going off and hitting random players for large spikes of damage.

# Notes on Tanking

On **Normal**, this is as simple as taunting at the appropriate time and taking the **Phase Three** bombs out of the group.

On **Heroic**, this encounter for you will revolve around making sure the **1500-Pound DUDs** are soaked every time, and quickly picking up the adds during each **Giga Coils**, as there is a high chance of a DPS dying to these.

The **Ego Check** can be a surprising amount of damage at times and catch you unawares if you are not prepared for each one, as it typically happens during extreme raid damage.

# Defensive Usage

Defensives are best utilized during the **Scatterblast Cannisters** in **Phase One**, if you receive a **Sapper's Satchel** in any phase, during the **Big Bad Buncha Bombs** or if a **Giga Coils** is allowed to persist for some time.  

In **Phase Three**, using personals on **Suppressions** is best.

# Movement Cooldowns

Movement Cooldowns will be very impactful in this encounter. You will want to use them, for the most part, during the **Big Bad Buncha Bombs** to aid in properly spreading out **Sapper's Satchels** and **Overloaded Rockets**, or for the **Fused/Tick-Tock Cannisters**.

In **Phase Three**, movement cooldowns are extremely effective against **Suppression**.

# Damage Profile Best Suited for this Encounter

As of this moment, this does seem to be another encounter where Single Target with efficient cleave is best. There are a fair amount of adds throughout this encounter, but damage to **Gallywix** is what really matters.
