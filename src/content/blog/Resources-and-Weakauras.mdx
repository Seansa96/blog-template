Listed here are Weakauras and other resources I've found useful.

# Raid Resources

* Obviously my guides are the best (humble guy I know), but for video content, I'd recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dratnos/videos">Dratnos for his video guides, when he makes them</a>.

I personally use Northern Sky's Liberation of Undermine pack since it was what was available before the race ended, although Liquid's pack is now available. Here are each of the Weakauras you need for it to work:

1. <a href="https://wago.io/Undermine"> Main Raid Weakaura</a> 
1. <a href="https://wago.io/NorthernSky">Database and Functions for the Main Raid Weakaura. **Required**.</a> 
1. <a href="https://wago.io/NSUndermine">Additional utility for the raid. Mainly for raid leading but useful for everyone.</a> 
1. <a href="https://wago.io/WeakAuraAnchors">Anchors for the above Weakauras. Not required.</a> 


You can use <a href="https://archon.gg">Archon</a> to quickly find talent builds/optimal setups for your class/spec. It's quicker than actually going to <a href="https://warcraftlogs.com">WCL</a>, but obviously not as good or as granular.

# Dungeon Resources

* I'd recommend the <a href="https://wago.io/twwdungeons">TWW Dungeons pack</a> by **Causese**. He makes these every season and they tend to be the best. This is the main one you need.

You can utilize the following as well, and I highly recommend you do, although they aren't as *required* as the above is.

* <a href="https://wago.io/dungeoncasts">Abie's targeted casts and spells</a>
* <a href="https://wago.io/3bViaBtT1">M+ Automarker</a>. This is exceptionally useful for high keys and basically required to not overlap kicks.

I'd also recommend installing **OmniCD** and configuring it as you like for dungeons to see your parties defensives, damage cooldowns, and kicks.

You should also have a solid **Plater** profile with clear highlighting of dangerous mobs and emphasization for abilities. There are several that others have found of particular use. I recommend <a href="https://wago.io/PerclknQY">VesperalTV's</a> profile, which I use. Others that are quite popular are **Naowh's**, **AtrocityUI's**, **Quazii's**, and **Jundie's**. Just google these and you should be able to find them easily.

In terms of video guides, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@quaziiwow">Quazii</a> seems to be the most general and useful. I also recommend **AutomatikJak** for healers and **YoDaTV** for tanks.

# Streamers (Dungeon Focused)

It's generally best to find a streamer of relatively good IO for your spec as well. I'll compose a list here and work on keeping it updated.

*My minimum requirements here are title players in the past, content creators/well-known players, or 3.1k IO and above currently. They must also stream regularly (minimum 3+ days a week). Under-represented specs have lower requirements, just to have something here.*

# UI Packs

Using a full suite of pre-configured addons has become increasingly more popular. Many of these tend to be paid, however, requiring a subscription or the like. I personally do not use any of these, but know others have found them helpful, especially as Weakaura and addon bloat has become a bigger issue.

*Again, as a supporter of FOSS, I don't use or am paid to support any of these, but if this sounds like something that could help you, here you go.*

* <a href="https://uipacks.wago.io/pack/fragnanceui">FragnanceUI</a>
* <a href="https://uipacks.wago.io/pack/atrocityui">AtrocityUI</a>
* <a href="https://uipacks.wago.io/pack/naowhui">NaowhUI</a>
* Others can be browsed on <a href="https://uipacks.wago.io/search">Wago</a>

Full class UIs can also be found for free, with optional donations if you find their work satisfying enough to support on **Wago.io**.  I personally just take **Luxthos'** packs and tweak them to my liking, but use whatever looks good to you.
