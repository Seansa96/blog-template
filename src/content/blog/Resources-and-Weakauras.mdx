title: Resources and Weakauras

Listed here are Weakauras and other resources I've found useful.

# Raid Resources

* Obviously my guides are the best (humble guy I know), but for video content, I'd recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dratnos/videos">Dratnos for his video guides, when he makes them</a>.

I personally use Northern Sky's Liberation of Undermine pack since it was what was available before the race ended, although Liquid's pack is now available. Here are each of the Weakauras you need for it to work:

1. <a href="https://wago.io/Undermine"> Main Raid Weakaura</a> 
1. <a href="https://wago.io/NorthernSky">Database and Functions for the Main Raid Weakaura. **Required**.</a> 
1. <a href="https://wago.io/NSUndermine">Additional utility for the raid. Mainly for raid leading but useful for everyone.</a> 
1. <a href="https://wago.io/WeakAuraAnchors">Anchors for the above Weakauras. Not required.</a> 


You can use <a href="https://archon.gg">Archon</a> to quickly find talent builds/optimal setups for your class/spec. It's quicker than actually going to <a href="https://warcraftlogs.com">WCL</a>, but obviously not as good or as granular.

# Dungeon Resources

* I'd recommend the <a href="https://wago.io/twwdungeons">TWW Dungeons pack</a> by **Causese**. He makes these every season and they tend to be the best. This is the main one you need.

You can utilize the following as well, and I highly recommend you do, although they aren't as *required* as the above is.

* <a href="https://wago.io/dungeoncasts">Abie's targeted casts and spells</a>
* <a href="https://wago.io/3bViaBtT1">M+ Automarker</a>. This is exceptionally useful for high keys and basically required to not overlap kicks.

I'd also recommend installing **OmniCD** and configuring it as you like for dungeons to see your parties defensives, damage cooldowns, and kicks.

In terms of video guides, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@quaziiwow">Quazii</a> seems to be the most general and useful. I also recommend **AutomatikJak** for healers and **YoDaTV** for tanks.

It's generally best to find a streamer of relatively good IO for your spec as well. I'll compose a list here and work on keeping it updated.

* NYI.

# Evoker

As I am currently maining **Evoker**, you can generally take a look at my gameplay or logs to find out what's currently best. I basically just copy whatever **Sanghelios** does (current main Evoker of **Liquid** and imo best Evoker world). **Gilgvoker** is also very good. Here is my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sean6793/videos">YouTube</a>, where I usually will post random keys and kills of the bosses from a **Devastation Evoker** PoV.

I do also play every other class and spec, with **Havoc DH** being probably my best spec, followed closely by **Devastation**.
