title: Resources and Weakauras
---

Listed here are Weakauras and other resources I've found useful.

# Raid Resources

* Obviously my guides are the best (humble guy I know), but for video content, I'd recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dratnos/videos">Dratnos for his video guides, when he makes them</a>.

I personally use Northern Sky's Liberation of Undermine pack since it was what was available before the race ended, although Liquid's pack is now available. Here are each of the Weakauras you need for it to work:

1. <a href="https://wago.io/Undermine"> Main Raid Weakaura</a> 
1. <a href="https://wago.io/NorthernSky">Database and Functions for the Main Raid Weakaura. **Required**.</a> 
1. <a href="https://wago.io/NSUndermine">Additional utility for the raid. Mainly for raid leading but useful for everyone.</a> 
1. <a href="https://wago.io/WeakAuraAnchors">Anchors for the above Weakauras. Not required.</a> 


You can use <a href="https://archon.gg">Archon</a> to quickly find talent builds/optimal setups for your class/spec. It's quicker than actually going to <a href="https://warcraftlogs.com">WCL</a>, but obviously not as good or as granular.

# Dungeon Resources

* I'd recommend the <a href="https://wago.io/twwdungeons">TWW Dungeons pack</a> by **Causese**. He makes these every season and they tend to be the best. This is the main one you need.

You can utilize the following as well, and I highly recommend you do, although they aren't as *required* as the above is.

* <a href="https://wago.io/dungeoncasts">Abie's targeted casts and spells</a>
* <a href="https://wago.io/3bViaBtT1">M+ Automarker</a>. This is exceptionally useful for high keys and basically required to not overlap kicks.

I'd also recommend installing **OmniCD** and configuring it as you like for dungeons to see your parties defensives, damage cooldowns, and kicks.

You should also have a solid **Plater** profile with clear highlighting of dangerous mobs and emphasization for abilities. There are several that others have found of particular use. I recommend <a href="https://wago.io/PerclknQY">VesperalTV's</a> profile, which I use. Others that are quite popular are **Naowh's**, **AtrocityUI's**, **Quazii's**, and **Jundie's**. Just google these and you should be able to find them easily.

In terms of video guides, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@quaziiwow">Quazii</a> seems to be the most general and useful. I also recommend **AutomatikJak** for healers and **YoDaTV** for tanks.

# UI Packs

Using a full suite of pre-configured addons has become increasingly more popular. Many of these tend to be paid, however, required a subscription or the like. I personally do not use any of these, but know others have found them helpful, especially as Weakaura and addon bloat has become a bigger issue.

*Again, as a supporter of FOSS, I don't use or am paid to support any of these, but if this sounds like something that could help you, here you go.*

* <a href="https://uipacks.wago.io/pack/fragnanceui">FragnanceUI</a>
* <a href="https://uipacks.wago.io/pack/atrocityui">AtrocityUI</a>
* <a href="https://uipacks.wago.io/pack/naowhui">NaowhUI</a>
* Others can be browsed on <a href="https://uipacks.wago.io/search">Wago</a>




# Evoker

As I am currently maining **Evoker**, you can generally take a look at my gameplay or logs to find out what's currently best. I basically just copy whatever **Sanghelios** does (current main Evoker of **Liquid** and imo best Evoker world). **Gilgvoker** is also very good. Here is my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sean6793/videos">YouTube</a>, where I usually will post random keys and kills of the bosses from a **Devastation Evoker** PoV.

I do also play every other class and spec, with **Havoc DH** being probably my best spec, followed closely by **Devastation**.
