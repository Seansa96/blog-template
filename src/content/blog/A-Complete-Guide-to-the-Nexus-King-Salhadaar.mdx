title: A Complete Guide to the Nexus-King Salhadaar
---


The battle against the **Nexus-King** is one to open the pathway to **Dimensius** and ascend to the inner rings of the **Manaforge** itself.  This is a long, intense, and epic multi-phase encounter against the final pawn of the **All-Devouring**, who betrayed his people to the **Void Lord** in exchange for promises of untold power.

# Abilities

**Phase One**

* **Decree: Oath-Bound** - **Salhadaar** channels to inflict a high amount of damage to the raid over 6 seconds upon being pulled.  This applies 3 stacks of **Oath-Bound** to each player.  **On Heroic and higher**, suffering fatal damage does not kill the player, but converts them to the **Shadowguard**, healing them to full health and switching their allegiance to the **Nexus-King**, charming them until death and causing them to inflict 100% increased damage and healing. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/decreeoath.webp"/>
* **Invoke the Oath** - **Salhadaar** ends the phase with this cast, dealing moderate damage to the raid and converting any player still afflicted by **Oath-Bound** to his side.
* **Subjugation Rule** - The **Nexus-King** begins a four-part combo, casting a completely random sequence of **Conquer** and **Vanquish**.  He may cast any ability in any order, but he can only cast two of each. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/subjugationrule.webp"/>
* **Conquer** - The **Nexus-King** casts this on his current target, inflicting a massive amount of damage split amongst all members within the indicator, and increasing their damage taken by **Conquer** by 100% for 20 seconds. **This removes 1 stack of Oath-Bound**.  This also knocks up all players hit. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/conquer.webp"/>
* **Vanquish** - The **Nexus-King** casts this at his current target, dealing massive damage to his target and anyone struck by the cone, increasing their damage taken by **Vanquish** by 100% for 20 seconds.<img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/vanquish.webp"/>
* **Besiege** - Several images of **Salhadaar's Royal Voidwing** appear around the encounter space. Coming too close to them causes them to lash out, knocking the player back and dealing moderate damage.  Occasionally, the images begin a sequence of breath attacks, raining down entropic fury upon the battlefield.<img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/besiege.webp"/>
* **Behead** - The **Royal Voidwing** marks several players with a line, then in short order deals a moderate burst of damage to them and leaves a **Cosmic Rip** in the indicated visual, which persists for the entirety of **Phase One**.<img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/behead.webp"/>
* **Banishment** - **Salhadaar** places a debuff on several players that deals moderate damage over time, ending in a burst of damage when it expires.
* **Tyranny** - Moderate rot throughout the entirety of the phase.

**Phase Two** 

* **Coalesce Voidwing** - **Salhadaar** summons his mount after a long cast, dealing fatal damage to any players caught within the visual before mounting his void dragon, which has its own health pool and is targetable but effectively one unit with its master.
* **Netherbreaker** - The **Nexus-King** marks several players with large circles before throwing his mace at them, which ricochets between all targets and leaves behind a nether portal after dealing high damage to anyone within 20 yards. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/netherbreaker.webp"/>
* **Cosmic Maw** - The **Voidwing** inflicts massive physical damage to its current target, inflicting them with a debuff that increases damage taken by **Dimension Breath** by 100% for 10 seconds.
* **Dimension Breath** - The **Voidwing** unleashes a beam of cosmic energy at its current target, dealing high damage every 0.3 seconds.  These beams are echoed from the positions players deposited their **Netherbreaker** circles. **On Heroic and higher**, **Dimension Glare** is applied to the target of the **Breath**, dealing damage to the raid based on how much they were able to mitigate it after 2 seconds. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/dimensionglare.webp"/>

**Intermission One**

* **Rally the Shadowguard** - The **Nexus-King** calls in his forces on the adjacent platforms, requiring the raid to split into two groups to address their presence.  Players must use the ExtraActionButton provided by the **Reshii Wraps** to travel to these platforms. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/intermissiongate.webp"/>
* **Seal the Forge** - The **Nexus-King** begins channeling energy into the **Manaforge** itself in an attempt to prevent players from breaking through to **Dimensius**, dealing high damage to any player on the main platform. The boss is also protected by a **Royal Ward** at this time, taking 99% reduced damage.

There are several adds available on each side, with both sides having the exact same composition.

* **Manaforged Titan** - This uses **Dread Mortar**, which fires a barrage of artillery that deals high damage to any players struck, and casts **Self-Destruct** when it reaches full energy, wiping both platforms after 10 seconds if not killed.
**Dread Mortar** <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/dreadmortar.webp"/>
* **Nexus-Princes** - Each side has a **Nexus-Prince**, who have different names but the exact same abilities.  The first is **Netherblast**, an interruptible cast that deals high damage to a single player, and **Nexus Beams**, which causes a set of beams to rotate around the **Nexus-Prince**, dealing high damage to any player struck. 
**Nexus Beams** <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/nexusbeam.webp"/>
* **Shadowguard Reaper** - These melee and cast **Reap**, teleporting behind a random player and dealing moderate damage to them and afflicting them with a light, long-lasting DoT.

**Intermission Two**

* **King's Hunger** - Desperate, **Salhadaar** sacrifices his mount, draining its essence over 30 seconds, increasing its damage taken by 100% and dealing high damage to the raid during this time. Upon completion, he will heal himself for amount proportional to the **Voidwing's** remaining health. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/"/>
* **Behead** - Instead of afflicting random players with lines, the **Voidwing** claws out at its enemies in random directions, dealing high damage to any player struck.

**Phase Three**

* **Galactic Smash** - **Salhadaar** summons several images of himself and strikes several players as well as his primary target with cosmic force, applying **Twilight Scar**, a moderate long-lasting DoT and dealing moderate damage per target to all players, as well as pulling players towards them. This damage is reduced by distance, and the targets of this ability spawn **Dark Stars** at their location. The current tank suffers **Starshattered**, taking massive physical damage and increasing damage taken from **Starshattered** by 100% for 40 seconds. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/galacticsmash.webp"/>
* **Dark Star** - This star spawns **Twilight Spikes** from its location, ever-expanding rings that deal a large amount of cosmic damage to any players struck.  Any players that touch the **Dark Star** suffer lethal damage and are slowed by 60%. **On Heroic and higher**, these stars orbit the arena. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/twilightspikes.webp"/>
* **Starkiller Swing** - **Salhadaar** repeats his opening salvo, summoning several images and striking marked players after a cast, applying **Twilight Scar** to them and dealing moderate damage to any players struck by the indicated line.  The current tank suffers **Starshattered**, taking massive physical damage and increasing damage taken from **Starshattered** by 100% for 40 seconds.  If this hits a **Dark Star**, it consumes it, causing it to explode for light damage per **Star**. If it does not hit a **Dark Star**, it instead deals massive damage to the entire raid. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/starkillerswing.webp"/>

# Strategy (Normal and Heroic)

**You should lust on the second intermission during the damage amp, as this will yield the greatest return on lowering the boss's health.**

**Phase One** begins with the boss standing still and proclaiming his **Decree: Oath-Bound**.

* You may choose to tank the boss in the center and drop the **Behead** lines as far as you can take them to the edges while dodging in the middle, but this is needlessly difficult.  I recommend dragging the boss to any edge of the arena and moving clockwise or counter-clockwise as needed, as this makes dealing with the **Besiege** overlaps significantly easier.
* If you choose to tank the boss at the edges and moving it along, players can simply deposit their **Behead** lines behind the raid, opposite of the direction the tanks will be moving the boss.
* The raid will need to clear their stacks in two separate groups. The tanks should bring the **Conquer** soak *to the raid*, in a consistent fashion.
* The complete random nature of the **Subjugation Rule** combo can make the taunting and swapping of the boss quite awkward at times.  You simply do not want to take the same ability twice during the combo, and thus should only taunt when the other tank is in danger of dying to a repeat ability.
* **Vanquish** should be pointed in a consistent direction every single time, and players should make sure they know where that will be, and avoid dodging in that direction.
* Players need to make sure they are cleared of all three stacks of **Oath-Bound** by the end of the phase. If a player misses a soak, they will need to soak twice on the next set, if applicable, by using personals or calling for externals.

**Phase Two**

* After casting **Invoke the Oath**, **Salhadaar** will summon his mount with **Coalesce Voidwing**. He will then cast **Netherbreaker**, and shortly after cast a **Dimension Breath**. Once this sequence is over, he will transition to the first **Intermission**.

**Intermission One**

* As mentioned, the raid needs to split up into two groups, a tank in each group, and go to the platforms adjacent to the main platform utilizing their **Reshii Wraps**.
* The goal is to kill the **Manaforged Titan** as quickly as possible, or the entire raid will wipe to the **Self-Destruct** cast.
* You may set up a kick rotation on the **Nexus-Prince**, or yolo-kick. Whatever you feel is necessary. You should only need a relatively short kick list.
* Be wary of **Dread Mortar** and the **Nexus Beam** cast overlapping. Otherwise, this phase is relatively simple and lax.

**Phase Two**

* After both sides are cleared, the boss will become active in the middle again and will continue with the sequence described earlier, with **Behead** thrown in to complicate space.
* After a few rotations of this, on a timer, he will enter the **second intermission**.

**Intermission Two**

* This plays similar to the **first intermission** of **Silken Court**. The raid will need to dodge high damage lines while dealing as much damage as possible to the **Voidwing**. This is where I recommend lusting and making sure CDs are available to deal as much damage as possible, as this will effect how much health the **Nexus-King** has in **Phase Three**.

**Phase Three**

* **Salhadaar** will begin the phase with a **Galactic Smash**. The targeted players should run out and try to get equidistant from each other, going as far as they are able to.
* Rings of **Twilight Spikes** will erupt, expanding outward from the **Dark Stars**, which on **Heroic and higher** will be orbiting around the room.  The raid will need to adjust to get to the safe spots as they become available.  While this is movement intensive, it is necessary due to **Starkiller Swing**.
* When targeted by **Starkiller Swing**, players will need to quickly select their own **Dark Star** to either hide behind, or stand in front of. The projectile will pierce players, although it will do a significant amount of damage to them. However, making sure the **Dark Star** is hit is more important than avoiding this damage by hiding behind one. Walking through a **Dark Star** will quickly kill you. 
* When done successfully, this will result in three **Dark Stars** being destroyed. If any players fails, it will likely result in a wipe without massive raid cooldowns being invested. Other players should make sure they are not in the path or they will suffer likely fatal damage.
* This is the reason why you do not want to take the **Galactic Smashes** to the very edge of the platform, as players will be unable to reasonably hide behind the **Dark Stars** in time due to how quick **Starkiller Swing** goes off.
* The boss will spawn more and more **Dark Stars**, with the raid only being able to destroy three at a time, eventually overwhelming the players in addition to the reduced encounter space.
* The hardest part of each cycle is the second **Starkiller Swing**, which sends the debuff out as the **Twilight Spikes** are still active. This is where raid movement should be utilized.
* Tanks can simply taunt off on either **Galactic Smash** or **Starkiller Swing**.
# Mythic Changes

* Pacing of the abilities is massively sped up.
* In **Phase One**, spirits of past oathbreakers will appear and attempt to return stacks of **Oath-Bound** to the player, one spirit per missing stack. You must face these spirits after each tank combo to remain free of the oath. <img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.shawnzhome.com/shawnzhome/videos/MO/nexus-king/vengefulspirit.webp"/>
* In **Phase Two**, **Netherbreaker** is gone, and instead the portals spawn in static locations and follow a specific sequence. Any player hit by **Dimension Breath**, whether from the boss or these portals, suffers **Dimension Glare**, likely wiping the raid.
* In the **first intermission**, each **Nexus-Prince** is now protected by an **Ethereal Barrier**, shielding them for 50% of their health.  **Shadowguard Reapers** now cast **Twilight Massacre**, dealing high damage in a line aimed at a random player.  If this hits the **Nexus-Prince**, it deals massive damage to their barrier.
* In **Phase Three**, the **Dark Stars** have undergone massive changes. They are no longer destroyed when hit by **Starkiller Swing**, but simply reverse orbit. If any **Dark Star** collides with another, they wipe the raid. If any **Dark Star** is struck by two or more **Starkiller Swings** at once, it wipes the raid.

# Mythic Strategy

The changes to this encounter transform an already difficult and frenetic battle into a chaotic fight for survival.

**Phase One**

* It is almost suicide to tank the boss in the middle now, and you should instead drag the boss to the edge and drag it around the room, dropping **Beheads** behind the raid's movement.
* The **Besiege** breaths now are much, *much* faster and incredibly deadly, and must be constantly accounted for.
* Players must remain cognizant of their spirits after each tank combo and face each one. Failing to face even one of these spirits means they will likely be mind-controlled when the phase ends, requiring them to be killed and forcing the expenditure of a battle rez.

**Phase Two**

* The general tempo of the **Dimension Breaths** is *In, then Out*. This is the best possible time to use movement speed increases and cooldowns in order to get to the safe spots. If even one player fails to dodge these beams, it will likely result in the death of the entire raid without massive damage reductions.

**Intermission Two**

* The only part of the encounter that has seen little change, and is simply just unforgiving now as being hit by anything will result in death, while the relative importance of dealing maximum damage here is heightened.

**Phase Three**

* Liquid/Echo waiting room. However, I'll discuss what will probably be the most likely strategy.
* The platform can be envisioned as essentially a concentric ring for the purpose of this phase.  Likely, the best option will be to place the first stars on the farthest arc, near the edge of the platform.  The goal will be to hit each "group" of stars and keep them all on the same alignment, essentially.
* Each **Galactic Smash** will need to be placed closer and closer to the center of the platform, causing it to deal more and more damage as time progresses.  This makes it so that on each cycle, you are only trying to hit the closest orbiting stars.
* This is relatively simple logistically, but quite difficult to execute. To avoid death on particularly bad overlaps, some players will *have* to make it behind the stars instead of letting it pierce them, which is much easier said than done.
* There are other ways this could be done as well. Due to the rule of not being able to hit the same star twice, and the fall-off damage and the pull-in forcing you to space them out, at the bare minimum, you know that you have to form these "layers" of **Dark Stars** in order to avoid their collision.
