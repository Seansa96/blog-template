title: ALL Guides will be updated today or tomorrow (More Info Inside)
---

Hey all,

I may finally rest, as my main is 656 bags (651 equipped).  It was a pretty good week for me, with your boy snagging a few rank 1s due to this crazy buff they introduced to Evokers called **Power Infusion**. I'm like 2500 IO or something as well, not that I push keys but pretty cool I guess?

My guild killed 6/8H and we almost killed **Mug'Zee** but ran out of time. Almost done with my vault (2 more 10s to go) and I have some thoughts on the recent nuke they dropped on keys.

Unfortunately, my grandmother passed last week, so I have a funeral to attend to today that will take up most of the day. I'll be working on the guides after I return. Some changes will be up tonight, all will be up tomorrow. 

GLHF out there, good loot to you all and to all a good night (well, it's morning right now, but...like maybe you'll be reading this at night or something).
