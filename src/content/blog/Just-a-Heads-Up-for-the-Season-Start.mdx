title: Just a Heads Up for the Season Start
---

Hey all, hope you're enjoying the site. Just wanted to remind everyone who visits that the guides have been updated for the most recent changes and will continue to receive iterations throughout this week.

Again, I'm a player too, so I wouldn't expect any large changes tomorrow during peak hours as I will be slamming keys and raiding.  

The **Gallywix** Preview is pretty sufficient for now imo, and fairly accurate. The **A Complete Guide** version will be up probably Friday at the latest, depending on how geared I am by Thursday. I may throw in some changes to the Preview version so that it's more suitable when I have free time.

I wish you all luck this first week, and pray that you don't get **Priory** or **Floodgate**. GLHF!
