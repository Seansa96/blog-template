  Hey, this is my site. Thanks for visiting. I play games, write about them,
  write about fantasy and science and history and...just about everything.

On this site you can find a wide array of content. I'm a strong believer in free open-source everything. That means I'll never charge a dime for anything you see here. I may eventually turn on ads (which you are free to block with your flavor of ad-block software) to help cover the costs of the site, but never anything explicit in terms of charging you money.

You're free to donate, of course, if you feel I've provided you something worth it. But as of this moment I still don't have that set-up yet.

Well, that's all I got for now. GLHF
